       "'Washington (CNN)When President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been \"arrested\" in the context of the civil rights movement -- even suggesting this had happened more than once -- it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.   Biden\\'s imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones. The President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures -- sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point.   Unlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year. Read MoreSo Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes. Here is a roundup of Biden\\'s first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below.False claims about his own pastBiden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods -- more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors -- that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.And like some of Trump\\'s tall tales about his past, Biden\\'s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.While talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, \"I used to drive a tractor-trailer,\" though only for \"part of a summer.\" This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, \"I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,\" adding, \"I got to.\" There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).Biden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled \"17,000 miles\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.Biden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.) And Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community. The 7 most important lines from Joe Biden\\'s news conferenceAt a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered \"spending time at\" and \"going to\" Pittsburgh\\'s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue\\'s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be \"the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.\" There is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a \"liaison\" with a major adversary. False claims about AfghanistanBiden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation -- further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.In August, the President said, \"What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?\" Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn\\'t \"gone\" -- as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan \"never made any sense to me\" -- though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.In July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said \"the law doesn\\'t allow\" Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn\\'t true, given the administration\\'s authority to grant \"parole,\" and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn\\'t permitted. In December, Biden said in another interview that \"I\\'ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.\" While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start -- as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.  False claims about the economyThe state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.Biden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was \"kind of back to what it was before the pandemic\"; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.To try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody\\'s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth -- wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs. Later in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody\\'s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase \"longer-term\" from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would \"ease longer-term inflationary pressures\" -- leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.False claims about the Covid-19 pandemicMany of Biden\\'s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor\\'s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear. But Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.At the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that \"you\\'re not going to get Covid\" if you\\'re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President\\'s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that \"if you\\'re vaccinated, you\\'re not going to be hospitalized, you\\'re not going to be in the ICU unit and you\\'re not going to die\"; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people. Biden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration\\'s work to get Americans vaccinated -- misleadingly playing down the Trump administration\\'s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.In February, Biden claimed that \"suicides are up\" amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were \"over 800,000\" vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.False claims in unscripted settingsWhen Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn\\'t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies -- making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.During Biden\\'s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration. And he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans\\' new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says. Washington (CNN)The Capitol insurrection was based on a lie about the 2020 election. And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about. Donald Trump supporters\\' violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.They have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a \"protest\" against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.They have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as \"political prisoners.\"Here is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.Read MoreLie: The rioters were completely unarmedTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.In a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a \"completely unarmed protest.\" Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, \"One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don\\'t feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law.\" Facts First: It\\'s not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed -- and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far \"over 75\" people charged in connection to the attack \"have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\" We may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.Mark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, \"you\\'d be here for another reason.\"Guy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt \"specifically targeted at least two lawmakers -- the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell -- whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building.\" And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.Mark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty. In addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.Lie: The rioters were merely protesting a \\'rigged\\' election Trump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a \"wild\" protest against President Joe Biden\\'s victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to \"fight like hell.\"After the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months -- and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the \"real insurrection\" was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a \"day of protesting.\" (He also made similar claims later in the year.)Facts First: Both parts of Trump\\'s claim are obvious lies. The election wasn\\'t rigged and wasn\\'t fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden\\'s 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 -- in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted -- involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.\"This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,\" Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: \"The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue.\" Lie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police A common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers. Trump said in a book interview in March that \"the Capitol Police were ushering people in\" and \"the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing.\" The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack \"were invited in by Capitol Police.\"Facts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.Rioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. There are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building. Since we don\\'t have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it\\'s theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal \"conduct unbecoming\" that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations. But no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it\\'s clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: \"The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true.\" Lie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners One of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become \"political prisoners\" while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement \"are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals\" but are \"political prisoners who are now being persecuted\"; he suggested that there are \"nearly 200\" nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September\\'s \"Justice for J6\" rally said its event was meant \"to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.\"Facts First: This \"political prisoners\" narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups. It\\'s true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it\\'s obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden\\'s political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.A few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments. Lie: January 6 was a false flag attackBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame -- claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence. Such \"false flag\" theories -- that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump\\'s opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad -- never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that \"FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.\" Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): \"It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6.\" And Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, \"You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating.\" Facts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to \"fight like hell\" and to march to the Capitol. The rioters\\' allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews. Though there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters -- and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.Carlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI -- The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant -- the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated \"false flag\" operation. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by \"deep state\" liberals trying to set up Trump supporters. \"It\\'s the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example. It\\'s un-American to be spreading those kinds of lies, and they are lies,\" Cheney said.CNN\\'s Holmes Lybrand and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this article. Washington (CNN)FBI Director Christopher Wray was live on CNN and MSNBC when he told a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday morning that the FBI had not yet found any evidence that subscribers to the Antifa movement were involved in the January attack on the US Capitol. At that moment, Fox News was in a commercial break from its regular programming. It had just urged viewers to stay tuned for a segment about educators \"canceling\" Dr. Seuss. And so America\\'s most popular right-wing television network again missed a chance -- or, perhaps, again chose to miss a chance -- to confront its viewers with the debunking of a lie that has become a widespread belief among right-wing Americans.In part because of Fox, the conspiracy theory has become pervasive in conservative circles. Opinion polls suggest that a large percentage of Republicans baselessly think that Antifa was primarily responsible for the insurrection that was actually perpetrated by supporters of former President Donald Trump, some of whom have allegedly expressed irritation that Antifa has been given the credit for their own behavior.In a January poll by the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, 50% of Republicans said Antifa was mostly responsible for the violence at the Capitol. A January poll by NBC found that 48% of Republican registered voters thought Antifa was solely or mainly responsible for the Capitol riot. Read MoreThe problem is bigger than FoxFox News deserves part of the blame for this worrying state of affairs. Some of its most prominent personalities have given fuel to the lie. Other Fox personalities have joined Trump in generally overhyping the danger posed by Antifa -- a far-left, sometimes violent collection of self-described anti-fascists -- thus priming viewers to perceive a movement that has been much less deadly than far-right extremism as a principal threat to the nation. But the problem here is bigger than any one media outlet. The lie about Antifa and the Capitol has been promoted by a large roster of right-wing people and entities. They include right-wing television networks Newsmax and One America News; Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Trump impeachment attorney Michael van der Veen; Republican members of Congress like Rep. Mo Brooks, Rep. Matt Gaetz and Sen. Ron Johnson; Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Republican state legislators; former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin; right-wing conspiracy websites like The Gateway Pundit; and popular right-wing commentators on social media and talk radio. The peddlers of the lie have found a tiny nugget of truth to help their cause. Of more than 260 Capitol defendants who have been revealed by the Department of Justice to date, one of them, John Sullivan, is a political oddball who has used the hashtag #antifa on social media. But left-wing activists have previously expressed suspicion about him, the FBI has never claimed that he is an actual Antifa activist and, regardless, the list of people charged over the riot is overwhelmingly composed of Trump supporters -- including, as Wray testified Tuesday, militia members and White supremacists. A history of blaming AntifaIn a well-reported story this week, The New York Times identified a false article published by the conservative Washington Times on the day of the insurrection as particularly impactful in the spread of the lie that Antifa was responsible. The article, which the Washington Times later corrected, wrongly claimed that a facial recognition company had identified two Antifa members at the Capitol. There\\'s no doubt that the inaccurate version of the article went viral on social media. If it hadn\\'t, though, some other Antifa-related lie almost certainly would have.Joan Donovan, research director at Harvard University\\'s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, noted that right-wing media has found a way to falsely blame Antifa for everything from mass shootings to wildfires. The lie about Antifa orchestrating the Capitol attack, Donovan said, is part of \"a very long disinformation campaign against the left\" by a \"right-wing media ecosystem that wants to shift the blame for anything bad that happens in our society.\"And much of the ecosystem of right-wing media consumers is willing to eat it up. As impossible as it seems to get Fox News and other lucrative right-wing platforms to behave more responsibly in supplying information, it seems just as hard to address the demand-side problem. Between the popularity of absurd lies about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama, the rise of the bonkers QAnon movement, the popularity of Trump\\'s lies about the 2020 election and now the popularity of this lie about Antifa and the Capitol, it appears clear that millions of right-wing Americans are eager to believe in outlandish conspiracy theories about their political opponents.  Fact-checkers will keep debunking the nonsense. But we know that in the short term there is no number of fact checks or statements from the FBI that can convince millions of Americans that they are wrong.  (CNN)Voting ends in the first primaries for the 2022 midterm elections in a matter of days.Texas will kick things off on March 1, and the primary process will wrap up more than six months later on September 13 in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.The outcome of November\\'s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden\\'s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.The majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they\\'re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.In the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.Read MoreThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors -- with 36 seats up for grabs this November -- including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.Here are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:March 1: Texas primariesTexas Gov. Greg Abbott The Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.There is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton\\'s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.In south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar\\'s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the \"ongoing investigation.\"The Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He\\'s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor\\'s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn\\'t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary. April 5: Special election primary in California\\'s 22nd Congressional DistrictFormer GOP Rep. Devin NunesFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump\\'s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.May 3: Indiana and Ohio primariesOhio Gov. Mike DeWineThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio \"like a blue-state liberal.\" On the Democratic side, it\\'s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton\\'s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati\\'s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.In the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders -- most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance -- have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn\\'t fully embrace the former President.After a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018. May 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primariesWest Virginia Rep. David McKinleyWest Virginia is poised to hold the country\\'s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump\\'s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package. In Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.Meanwhile, in Nebraska\\'s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.May 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primariesCelebrity doctor Mehmet OzThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party\\'s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.Democrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party\\'s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.There is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth\\'s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.In North Carolina, Trump\\'s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump\\'s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.Idaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a \"a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.\"May 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)Georgia Gov. Brian KempThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a \"Trump ticket\" of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.The top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden\\'s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump\\'s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump\\'s efforts to undermine the state\\'s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump\\'s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.While the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump\\'s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump\\'s demands that he \"find\" the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state\\'s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President\\'s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.The Atlanta area will host the year\\'s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath\\'s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans -- McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020. Georgia won\\'t be the only state testing the power of Trump\\'s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President\\'s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.In Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders -- a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee -- has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father\\'s footsteps and become Arkansas\\' first female governor.June 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California\\'s 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)California Gov. Gavin NewsomLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office -- which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.Sen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term. California is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state\\'s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State\\'s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state\\'s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.GOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn\\'t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council. Another race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.Prior to serving as Trump\\'s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he\\'s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state. June 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primariesNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez MastoNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party\\'s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.In the Silver State\\'s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.The fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump\\'s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.In Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks -- with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago. June 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)Virginia Rep. Abigail SpanbergerLast November\\'s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP\\'s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave -- Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman\\'s home near Richmond. Luria\\'s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.June 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)Illinois Rep. Mary MillerThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.The GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump\\'s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.Democrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party\\'s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.On the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. With popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor\\'s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan\\'s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.July 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)The calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.August 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primariesArizona Secretary of State Katie HobbsTwo states at the center of Trump\\'s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day -- Arizona and Michigan.Sparked by the former President\\'s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden\\'s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump\\'s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results. Current Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state\\'s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.Finchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.Trump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President\\'s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election. In Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who\\'ve spread election falsehoods -- Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump\\'s efforts to undermine the state\\'s 2020 election results.Michigan Gov. Gretchen WhitmerDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden\\'s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.The new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district\\'s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.GOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan\\'s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President. Trump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he\\'s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.Two House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump\\'s impeachment -- Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse -- will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.In Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.August 4: Tennessee primariesFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan OrtagusTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper\\'s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President -- US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn -- are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well. August 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primariesWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.The GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders. The last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain \"yes\" when asked whether they thought Biden won a \"constitutional majority in the Electoral College.\"Ultimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don\\'t earn that nod.Vermont is the only state in the union that\\'s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy\\'s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state\\'s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That\\'s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he\\'s yet to announce his plans.Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year. August 13: Hawaii primariesHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh GreenTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state\\'s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate. Hawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November. August 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary) Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Two of Trump\\'s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President\\'s sway in the GOP. There is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump\\'s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney\\'s favor are her family\\'s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump\\'s support.Murkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska\\'s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state\\'s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before -- winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski\\'s bid.August 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.Three Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis\\' rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida\\'s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.Before DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP\\'s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he\\'s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida\\'s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.The outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles. September 6: Massachusetts primariesFormer state Rep. Geoff DiehlThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump\\'s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump\\'s endorsement. But while Diehl won\\'t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn\\'t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn\\'t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.  On the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they\\'ll avoid such a fate this November. September 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primariesNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie HassanDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP\\'s top targets in 2022, but the party\\'s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu\\'s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire\\'s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who\\'s received praise from McConnell. Redistricting is poised to make New Hampshire\\'s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.There will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor\\'s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden\\'s commerce secretary last year, and he\\'s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren\\'t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS. November 8: Election Day; Open primaries in Louisiana  (CNN)President Joe Biden is facing historically low approval ratings among independents, a trend that threatens Democrats in November\\'s midterm elections if he can\\'t reverse it by then.Although the number of truly independent swing voters has declined over the past half century, they can still provide the margin between electoral victory and defeat at a time when the two party coalitions are so closely balanced. And after moving toward Democrats in the 2018 and 2020 elections largely because of their distaste for Donald Trump, independents are now giving Biden job ratings in both state and national polls nearly as low as they ever provided Trump.Independents \"swung heavily against Republicans in 2018 and 2020 because they hated Donald Trump,\" says Dick Wadhams, the former Republican state chair in Colorado. \"Now these same unaffiliated voters are looking at the guy in the White House, Democrats in Congress, Democrats in the state legislatures, and I don\\'t think they like what they see.\"After the frequent promises of \"transformative\" leadership during his first year, Biden\\'s more meat-and-potatoes State of the Union address -- with its emphasis on such centrist themes as funding, rather than \"defunding,\" the police -- struck many analysts in both parties as a reset with those less partisan voters. Some national polling and other analysis since the speech suggest that the address, along with Biden\\'s visibility leading the Western response to Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, may, in fact, be generating a second look for him among some of them. Is this the beginning of a Joe Biden comeback?During the speech, \"there were a variety of places where Democrats, independents and Republicans were traveling together in their responses in a way that is really heartening\" for Biden, says Democratic pollster Margie Omero, who observed the reactions of a \"dial group\" of voters to the remarks.Read MoreStill, most strategists in both parties agree it will take time, and sustained real world gains on inflation and the pandemic, for Biden to climb out of the hole he\\'s fallen into with independents, especially because so many of them say in recent polls that they do not consider him a strong leader. While Biden still has time to recover among them by 2024, Republican pollster Glen Bolger says the President faces much longer odds of a significant rebound before November\\'s midterm elections. Over that time frame, Bolger argues, \"it\\'s hard for independents to move from where they are to even a mixed rating of the guy.\" Given the tightening correlation between voter attitudes about the president and their choices in House and Senate races, that\\'s a daunting prospect for Democrats. Their best chance of avoiding a wipeout among independents this fall may revolve less around improving their view of Biden than rekindling their doubts about Republicans -- particularly their ties to Trump. Exactly how many voters qualify as true independents unaffiliated with either party is a matter of sustained dispute. In Gallup polling, about 4 in 10, and often more, adults have identified as independents since early in Barack Obama\\'s presidency. In the Edison Research exit polls conducted for a consortium of media organizations, the share of voters who identify as independents has varied only between 25% and 30% in every election in this century.But party operatives and political scientists agree that most of those independents are, as the saying goes, partisans who just don\\'t want to wear their team\\'s jerseys. After sorting out the self-described independents who lean reliably toward either side, Gallup consistently records a little more than 1 in 10 adults as fully independent. The Cooperative Election Study, a large-scale survey conducted by an academic consortium, likewise characterizes about 7% to 10% of voters as truly independent from both parties. Others put the number slightly higher: CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta says the network\\'s latest national survey identified about 1 in 6 Americans as truly unaffiliated with either side. Who are independent voters?Independents don\\'t entirely fit any one demographic or ideological profile: They include both well-educated voters who are socially liberal and fiscally conservative (probably the dominant image) as well as plenty of non-college voters who are the opposite. In fact, the composition of who identifies as an independent changes from election to election as events nudge voters in and out of allegiance to the two major parties: The share of self-identified independents, for instance, who called themselves conservative was much higher in the 2010 GOP landslide than in the sweeping 2018 Democratic midterm gains, according to exit poll data provided to CNN by Edison. The voters who identified as independent in 2018 were also younger and much better educated than in 2010.Compared with a generation ago, almost all campaigns in both parties have reduced their focus on persuading independents or swing voters and shifted more toward mobilizing their base supporters. But somewhat paradoxically, because each side has done so well at turning out its base, support from independents still often constitutes the tipping point in states or House districts closely balanced between the two sides. \"Even though deepening partisanship has reduced the number of swing voters, the narrow margins of our recent national elections has made these voters more important than ever,\" the veteran Democratic analysts William Galston and Elaine Kamarck wrote in a recent paper for the centrist Progressive Policy Institute. \"This reality will dominate national politics until one party breaks the deadlock of the past three decades and creates a decisive national majority.\"Exit polls of House elections over the past four decades provide one measure of that tipping-point role. The party that won more independents in the exit polls also won the national House popular vote in every election since 1986, with the sole exception of 2004, when House Republicans narrowly lost independents but still won more votes nationally because of the surge in GOP turnout that President George W. Bush engineered that year. The winning party carried independents by double-digit margins in each recent year with a big congressional swing: the major Democratic gains in 2006 and 2018 and the Republican sweeps in 1994, 2010 and 2014, exit polls found. It\\'s likely the case that some true independents are always voting for the lesser of two evils, so it\\'s not unusual for independents to be dissatisfied with the president they have voted for in the past election. The fact that they are true independents means they don\\'t like either party much anyway.Brian Schaffner, Tufts University political scientistThat\\'s the foreboding backdrop for Democrats assessing a flurry of new state and national polls showing Biden facing a huge decline among the broadly defined group of independent voters (which includes those who lean toward either party). In 2020, the exit polls showed Biden carrying 54% of independents and beating Trump among them by 13 percentage points; the Pew Research Center\\'s validated voters survey found only a slightly narrower margin for Biden. He roughly matched that vote with a 51% approval rating among independent adults in an April 2021 CNN poll, his high point among them in office.But the latest CNN national poll, conducted by SRSS, put Biden\\'s overall job approval rating among independents at just 36%, with 64% disapproving. The most recent national surveys by Gallup, CBS and Fox also put his rating with them around that level; pre-State of the Union polls by ABC/Washington Post and NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist were even worse, with each showing only around 3 in 10 independents approving. A post-State of the Union Marist poll showed his approval with those voters improving to nearly 4 in 10, but that still left about 6 in 10 of them disapproving.By historic standards, these are very low numbers with independents. In CNN polling, Biden\\'s standing with independents is only slightly above the lowest job approval the survey ever recorded among them for Trump (31%) or Obama (32%), according to Agiesta. Biden\\'s standing with independents in the Gallup survey matches Obama\\'s low point, though it still exceeds the nadir for Trump (30%) or George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, each of whom fell into the twenties at points.State polls tell the same story. The 2020 exit polls found Biden winning 53% or 54% of independent voters in two key swing states he carried -- Georgia and Wisconsin -- and more than 60% of them in a third, New Hampshire. But the most recent public state surveys in Georgia, New Hampshire and Wisconsin each put his current approval with independents at only around 1 in 3 or less.Biden is also scuffling with independents on other measures. In the latest CNN survey, just 33% of independent adults said his first year had been a success. Only 3 in 10 gave him good grades for handling the economy and just a little more than a third rated him positively on responding to crime. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, only 3 in 10 independents called him a strong leader; that number was only about 1 in 4 in the Fox survey. Why did this happen?Strategists in both parties generally agree that the same three dynamics have ground down Biden\\'s standing with independents, though they differ on the relative emphasis they place on each.• One is ideological backlash. \"I keep coming back to the idea that he ran as a centrist and he\\'s governed as a progressive and he\\'s betrayed the electorate, particularly in Arizona,\" says Charles Coughlin, a Republican public relations and political consultant in the state.• The second is doubts about Biden\\'s personal capacity for the job, measured in those recent surveys showing that roughly three-fifths of independents say they do not consider him a strong leader. • To both parties, though, probably the key driver of his decline is dissatisfaction with the country\\'s overall direction, particularly on inflation, the lingering disruptions created by the coronavirus and, particularly in larger cities, crime and homelessness. Yair Ghitza, the chief scientist at Catalist, a prominent Democratic targeting firm, expressed an opinion common in both parties when he told me that views among independents change more based on current conditions in the country than do opinions among more hard-core partisans. \"Most of the time you are going to see independents moving more than the strong partisans,\" he says.JUST WATCHEDHear CNN political director\\'s takeaways from post-SOTU pollReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear CNN political director\\'s takeaways from post-SOTU poll 03:26Brian Schaffner, a Tufts University political scientist who\\'s a co-director of the Cooperative Election Study, agrees that voters not fully attached to either party typically respond more than partisans to shifts in current events. In the November 2021 Cooperative Election Study annual survey, Biden\\'s approval rating among the voters the poll characterizes as true independents plummeted to just 25%. While that\\'s an extremely low number, Schaffner points out that only rarely did more than 40% of these true independents approve of either Obama or Trump. \"It\\'s likely the case that some true independents are always voting for the lesser of two evils, so it\\'s not unusual for independents to be dissatisfied with the president they have voted for in the past election,\" he says. \"The fact that they are true independents means they don\\'t like either party much anyway.\"While Republicans have been outraged and Democrats frustrated and demoralized by the big ideological congressional battles that have derailed Biden\\'s \"Build Back Better\" economic plan, many independents have seen the entire struggle as disconnected from their most pressing concerns, many analysts agree. \"They are not so ideologically\" engaged, says Coughlin. Instead their view is, \"I want to see it work. I want to see the border work; I want to see our country be strong again. I want to see the economy work; I want to see inflation go down.\"These attitudes are translating into scary early numbers among independents for Democrats in several polls. In the ABC/Washington Post survey, independents gave Republicans a 14-percentage-point lead when asked which party they intended to support in November\\'s election. For perspective, that\\'s roughly the level of advantage among independents in the exit polls that Republicans amassed during their 1994 House landslide and slightly bigger than the Democratic lead in 2018.Can Democrats turn things around?Can Democrats dig out of this hole by November? Andrew Baumann, a Democratic pollster based in Colorado, a state with a large number of independent voters, sees three big imperatives for the party among them.• One is for Biden to regain at least some of the ground he\\'s lost. \"He\\'s not probably going to get back to 50 with this group by November,\" Baumann says, \"but there is a big difference between 35% and 45.\" Most Democrats agree the key for any Biden revival with independents will be actual improvement in inflation and the virus. But many also believe that the chastened tone of his State of the Union address -- which replaced the promises of \"transformational\" leadership with more centrist language and reframed his economic plan as an effort to help families meet daily costs for child care, drugs and utilities -- was a step in the right direction. • Baumann\\'s second priority is for candidates to emphasize their own strengths and establish separation from Biden where necessary. That\\'s become harder to do, he acknowledges, in an era when attitudes toward the president increasingly shape voters\\' choices in House and Senate races. But polls suggest voters are still open to some differentiation: In a January Quinnipiac poll, for instance, the positive ratings among independents for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the key GOP targets in November\\'s election, stood 15 points higher than Biden\\'s.• Like many Democrats, though, Baumann thinks the key to Democrats\\' closing the gap with independents is to highlight the elements of the GOP\\'s agenda they dislike. \"You need to just make it clear that even if these voters are not happy with Biden that the alternative here is unacceptable,\" he says. Democrats have no shortage of targets for that effort, party strategists believe. For instance, even as the GOP majority on the Supreme Court nears a decision that could overturn Roe v. Wade and Republican-controlled states race to impose new limits (or effective bans) on abortion, a January CNN poll found that nearly three-fourths of independents want to maintain the constitutional right to the procedure. Omero says Biden\\'s defense of abortion rights in last week\\'s speech was one of the moments when the positive reaction among independents veered most sharply from the negative response among Republicans.When the president is suffering from low approval ratings, it\\'s common for his party to insist it will make the next election a choice, not a referendum. In practice, with views about the president exerting ever more influence over the results, that\\'s become more and more difficult to do. Schaffner, like other analysts, believes that while raising doubts about the Republican alternative may help Democrats win back independents disillusioned with Biden in the 2024 presidential election, history suggests that contrast message does not work as well in a midterm. Independents, he says, \"because they don\\'t like either party\" often engage in \"balancing behavior\" during midterms, which this year could translate into a view that \"I should vote Republican to cancel out my dislike of Biden.\"But the continued polarization around Trump may offer Democrats an opportunity to break that pattern. For one thing, he remains about as unpopular among independents as Biden is. For another, he remains unusually visible, pressing his unfounded claims of fraud in the 2020 election, touting his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the Ukraine invasion and confronting continued revelations about his campaign to overturn the election\\'s result, which culminated in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol last year. Wadhams, like many Republicans, is generally confident that Democrats can\\'t shift the focus for most voters, especially independents, from the current President to his predecessor.   (CNN)The Democratic Party\\'s early 2000s dream of an emerging majority based on a diversifying electorate has run into reality. Democrats lost the 2016 presidential election, and they barely won in 2020. Part of their problem was declining support among White voters.But the 2020 election also pointed to another problem: Hispanic voters (who are growing as a portion of the electorate) moving toward the Republican Party. Recent polling -- and now this week\\'s Texas primaries -- show that these Republican gains don\\'t seem to be going away anytime soon.Texas is a heavily Hispanic state relative to the country as a whole. There are 16 counties in Texas where Hispanics make up at least 80% of the citizen voting age population, according to the latest data available from Census Bureau. The county with the highest percentage of Hispanic adult citizens (Starr County) backed now-President Joe Biden by 5 points in 2020, after voting for Hillary Clinton by 60 points four years earlier. (That\\'s not a misprint. It really was a 55-point swing.)Regularly scheduled primaries, of course, don\\'t feature a Democratic candidate versus a Republican candidate. We can, however, look at the relative turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries. This is instructive in Texas where voters don\\'t register by party and can choose which party\\'s primary to vote in.Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump\\'s inroads in South TexasAll told, 27% of the Texans who voted Tuesday in the 16 most Hispanic counties cast a ballot in the Republican primary. This may not seem like a lot but consider that in 2018, just 15% of those who voted in either the Democratic or Republican primary cast a ballot on the Republican side.Read MoreIn Starr County, 24% of primary votes were cast on the Republican side Tuesday. It was basically nothing in 2018, with a mere 0.2% of primary votes being cast on the Republican side. That\\'s a 24-point shift.Compare this with what happened statewide in Texas this year. There was slight movement toward Republicans: Of the votes cast on the Democratic or Republican side, 65% were Republican primary votes. In 2018, it was 60%. This was a 4-point shift without rounding.Put another way, the shift in Republican primary participation in those 16 heavily Hispanic counties was nearly three times the statewide shift.More signs of a shiftTexas, though, is only one state. Further, it\\'s just a primary.But even on the national level, Texas does not seem to be that much of an outlier.While it\\'s not clear that Hispanic Americans have moved even more toward the Republicans relative to how Americans overall are shifting, it\\'s clear that Republicans are holding their gains from 2020.Trump made big in-roads in Hispanic areas across the nationNationally, the three polls that meet CNN standards for reporting (CNN/SSRS, Fox and Quinnipiac University) have produced generic congressional ballot results since the beginning of the year and provided a crosstab on Hispanic voters\\' midterm preferences. The generic ballot asks respondents some form of the following question: \"If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican Party?\"Democrats have held a 23-point advantage among Hispanics on the generic congressional ballot in the average of these polls so far this year.An average of three estimates of how Americans voted in House races in 2020 (Catalist, the CNN exit poll and the Pew Research Center) found that Democrats won the House vote by about 28 points in 2020 among Hispanics.This 5-point shift toward Republicans among Hispanics is in line with the 5-point shift we see among voters overall -- Republicans ahead by 2 points on the generic congressional ballot, compared with losing the national House vote by 3 points in 2020.The key thing to realize, though, is that Democrats did worse -- and Republicans did better -- among Hispanic voters in 2020 House races relative to the national vote than in any House election since 2004. So while not losing additional ground is not a bad thing for Democrats, it\\'s not a good thing either.The Biden factorIf anything, the picture gets better for Republicans when you examine Biden\\'s popularity. Across the CNN, Fox and Quinnipiac polls this year, the President\\'s net approval rating averages +2 points with Hispanic Americans. That\\'s 17 points better than his net approval rating with voters overall in these polls (-15 points).CNN Poll: Most Biden detractors say he\\'s done nothing they like since becoming presidentIn the 2020 election, Biden\\'s margin with Hispanic voters was about 23 points better than it was overall.So compared with 2020, Biden is doing worse with Hispanics relative to how he is doing with voters overall. That\\'s notable given that earlier in his presidency, Biden was doing significantly better among Hispanics relative to how he was doing overall and compared with how he did in 2020.This fits with an analysis from FiveThirtyEight\\'s Geoffrey Skelley, which found that Biden\\'s approval rating had fallen disproportionately among Hispanics over the course of his presidency.The fact that the political preferences of Hispanic Americans are jumping around may get at something larger: Their votes are up for grabs more so than the average voter\\'s. While they may still be more Democratic-leaning, both parties have a good chance of making up ground among the Hispanic electorate.I\\'d expect a lot of attention to be focused on this growing bloc of voters in the midterms.  (CNN)First, it was the feud between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Florida Sen. Rick Scott over the latter\\'s 11-point plan to \"rescue\" America if Republicans win majorities in Congress this fall.Now, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has caused a stir by suggesting -- and then un-suggesting -- that Republicans would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act if they retake power in Washington. \"For example, if we\\'re going to repeal and replace Obamacare — I still think we need to fix our health-care system — we need to have the plan ahead of time so that once we get in office, we can implement it immediately, not knock around like we did last time and fail,\" Johnson said during a Breitbart News Radio interview Monday morning first flagged by The Washington Post.That would be a very big deal! After all, congressional Republicans spent the better part of the last decade -- legislatively and legally -- trying to dismantle the ACA. They repeatedly failed in that effort. And despite a rocky start to the health care program -- the failure of the initial website to sign up for coverage being the most obvious example -- the public has warmed to the law, which is colloquially known as Obamacare. In an October 2021 Kaiser Family Foundation poll, almost 6 in 10 (58%) of Americans said they had a favorable view of the law, while just 41% viewed it unfavorably.Read MoreTaking the ACA away -- or even talking about taking it away -- then is politically unwise.Which may explain why Johnson, who faces re-election this year, released a statement Monday night, um, clarifying his position. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\\n\\n\\n\\n\"During a radio interview I used our failure to repeal and replace Obamacare as an example of how we need to be prepared to deliver on whatever agenda items we decide to run on,\" said Johnson. \"I was not suggesting repealing and replacing Obamacare should be one of those priorities. Even when we tried and failed, I consistently said our effort should focus on repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transitioning to a health system that works.\"Which, well, ok! But, the problem for Johnson -- and for McConnell and other members of Republican leadership -- is that Johnson initially said what he said, which sounded a whole lot like Republicans would work to repeal and replace Obamacare if they were in the Senate majority.It\\'s the latest problem for McConnell caused by members of his own conference, a series of self-inflicted wounds that give Democrats some hope that they may be able to retain their razor-thin majority in the Senate come November.Much of last week was taken up with a public back and forth between McConnell and Scott, the chair of Senate Republicans\\' campaign arm, over the Florida Republican\\'s decision to release his own policy agenda for America if/when Republicans regain the majority. The provisions in Scott\\'s plan include finishing construction of the southern border wall and naming it after former President Donald Trump, requiring all Americans to pay income taxes, and establishing a sunset provision for all federal legislation after five years. \"We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years,\" McConnell said in response last week. \"That will not be a part of the Republican Senate majority agenda.\"Not long after, Scott penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing: \"If we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to socialism, we don\\'t deserve to govern. Most Republicans in Congress agree, but many live in fear of speaking the truth in Washington.\"No sooner had that back and forth abated -- for the time being -- than this kerfuffle with Johnson sprung up, drawing swift Democratic condemnation. All of it works against McConnell\\'s most basic premise heading into the 2022 midterms: Make the entire election a referendum on President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats. That notion appears to be harder to execute in practice than to follow in principle. Wilmington, North Carolina (CNN)A federal judge on Friday shut down a legal challenge to GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn\\'s candidacy from a group of North Carolina voters and advocacy groups who claimed that an old provision of the US Constitution banned him from running because of his role on the January 6 insurrection. This means the constitutional challenge against Cawthorn is over, though Friday\\'s ruling could be appealed. It\\'s a major victory for the pro-Trump firebrand, and a loss for the coalition of constitutional scholars, anti-Trump Republicans and liberal activists who filed the challenge.The ruling was narrow, with Chief Judge Richard Myers concluding that a Civil War amnesty law passed by Congress in 1872 essentially repealed the 14th Amendment\\'s \"disqualification clause,\" which prohibited officeholders from returning to elected positions if they supported an insurrection, but also said Congress could remove that disability with a two-thirds vote.  Myers agreed with Cawthorn\\'s lawyers, who argued that the Amnesty Act of 1872 applied not only retroactively to Confederate officials, but also in perpetuity regarding future rebellions. Cawthorn has denied any wrongdoing regarding January 6 and says he isn\\'t an insurrectionist. As part of their case against Cawthorn, the challengers highlighted the fact that he posted militant tweets in the run-up to January 6 and spoke at Trump\\'s Ellipse rally before the attack. Read MoreMyers, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, handed down the ruling during a two-hour hearing at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, North Carolina, which featured arcane legal arguments and history lessons about the US Constitution, the post-Civil War amendments and how they apply today.\"We are at a moment in which interest in free and fair elections is at its peak,\" Myers said, adding that it was his responsibility as a federal judge to protect \"the soapbox... the ballot box... and the jury box. And when those fail, that\\'s when people proceed to the ammunition box.\"The anti-Cawthorn campaign was backed by a legal advocacy group called Free Speech For People, as well as Our Revolution, the left-wing group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders. They recruited North Carolina voters who live in Cawthorn\\'s district to challenge his candidacy. After they filed their challenge with the North Carolina State Board of Elections, Cawthorn sued the board in federal court to shut down the process. If the judge hadn\\'t intervened on Friday, the state election board would\\'ve eventually appointed a panel to hear the candidacy challenge, which would\\'ve had the power to depose Cawthorn or issue subpoenas for documents.  The federal case moved as a fast pace, and the judge agreed that Cawthorn needed legal relief quickly. North Carolina holds its primaries in May and will start printing ballots in the next several weeks. Debates over century-old laws The hearing was a striking display of the reality that America is grappling with a level of internal strife and democratic backsliding that hasn\\'t been seen since the Civil War. The bulk of Friday\\'s proceedings revolved around how century-old laws regarding insurrections apply to today. During the federal litigation, the North Carolina State Board of Elections was represented by lawyers from the state attorney general\\'s office, which is run by a Democrat. They maintained that the election board had the power to hear the challenge and would\\'ve had the power to disqualify Cawthorn based on the 14th Amendment, if there was enough supporting evidence. State prosecutor Terence Steed said during Friday\\'s hearing that the 1872 amnesty law only applied retroactively to Confederate officials and troops -- and not Cawthorn. He said Cawthorn was relying on an \"absurd interpretation\" of the law that \"defies logic\" to claim immunity. Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn cleans gun during virtual House hearing\"The 1872 Amnesty Act did not absolve all future insurrections,\" Steed said, pointing out that Congress used the 14th Amendment to disqualify a socialist lawmaker from office in 1919. That\\'s the same interpretation as a Gerard Magliocca, a law professor at Indiana University who is perhaps the leading scholar on the constitution\\'s \"disqualification clause.\" He was willing to testify on behalf of the challengers, and believes the old amnesty laws didn\\'t shield Cawthorn. The judge disagreed -- but said his ruling was narrow and essentially applied only to Cawthorn. \"The ruling will be reversed on appeal,\" Magliocca told CNN in an interview after the hearing. \"There are many problems with the argument that the 1872 law conferred amnesty onto all people forever who would engage in insurrection against the US Constitution. That\\'s not what it says. And nobody at the time thought that is what the law would do. Not a single person.\"Advocacy group says ruling is \\'absurd\\' Ron Fein, legal director of Free Speech For People, urged the state election board to appeal the decision immediately because the judge was \"wrong on the law\" and that his ruling was \"patently absurd.\" (The board\\'s lawyers declined to comment about any potential appeal.)\"Until the decision is overturned on appeal, the state process is on pause, and Madison Cawthorn is temporarily shielded from answering questions about whether his involvement in January 6 disqualifies him under the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Fein said in a statement. The group previously said it will try to disqualify additional pro-Trump Republicans in other districts who supported the efforts to violently overturn the 2020 election. But Friday\\'s ruling could derail those plans, or at least is a legal roadblock in one state. John Wallace, a Democratic lawyer who represented the challengers, said that \"the North Carolina voters who saw it fit to challenge Cawthorn\\'s candidacy now won\\'t have a chance to do so.\" Cawthorn\\'s team cheered the ruling, and echoed comments that the GOP lawmaker made last week, claiming that the candidacy challenge was an effort by left-wing groups to \"cancel\" him.  \"This is a concerted, well-funded national effort to undermine our democracy by disqualifying eligible people from running for office,\" Cawthorn lawyer James Bopp Jr. said after the hearing.This story has been updated with additional details.  (CNN)If the election were held today, Democrats would not only lose control of the House, but suffer massive losses in their ranks.That\\'s the conclusion that should be drawn from new ABC News/Washington Post polling that shows a generic Republican candidate leading a generic Democratic one by a 49% to 42% margin among registered voters nationally. (That gap expands to 13 points when you limit the sample to registered voters who say they are \"certain\" to vote.)That\\'s known as the generic ballot test. For decades, it\\'s been a reliable weathervane as to which way -- and how hard -- the partisan winds are blowing.  And what the ABC/Post poll makes clear is that the wind is blowing against the Democrats -- and hard.Read More How bad is it for Democrats? Consider where the generic ballot stood in ABC/Post polling taken just before other recent midterm elections: 2018: D+7 on generic ballot (Democrats won a net of 40 House seats) 2014: D+3 (Democrats lost a net of 13 seats) 2010: D+5 (Democrats lost a net of 64 seats) 2006: D+13 (Democrats won a net of 31 seats) What\\'s clear is that when the Democratic edge is five points or less on the generic ballot, the party has experienced major seat losses in midterm elections. Now consider what the House playing field might look like with a Republican edge of seven points on the generic ballot. (Among independent voters, largely considered the swing votes in elections, Republicans have a 14-point edge on the generic ballot in the latest ABC/Post poll.)  Like I said: Catastrophic. Now, the counter-argument goes like this: 1) It\\'s February 2022, not November 2022. 2) Redistricting across the country has severely constricted the number of competitive seats between the two parties. 3) After Republicans gained a net of 12 House seats in 2020, there is less low-hanging fruit out there.All true! And it still might not matter. The Point: Political waves tend to wash away members of Congress who looked safe and sound just a few months earlier. And if the generic ballot stays anywhere close to where it is today, Democrats could be facing a historically large wave.  (CNN)Joe Biden has been president for a little over a year. And that year was not kind to him. In a new NPR/PBS/Marist College poll, more than half -- 56% -- of Americans said that Biden\\'s first year in office was a \"failure,\" while just 39% described it as a success. The news doesn\\'t get better the more you dig into the survey. Two-thirds of independents said Biden\\'s first year was a failure, while more than 9 in 10 Republicans (91%) agreed with that assessment.Read More Biden\\'s numbers are better among Democrats -- 80% called year one a success -- but 15% of members of his own party described his first year in office as a failure. Now, asking such a binary question -- either Biden\\'s first year was a success or a failure, with no room in the middle -- does tend to strip any nuance from issue. There are incredible complexities that go into assessing how a president has done.  Oftentimes, a president is judged in one way during his time in office and in another after he leaves, once the impacts of his policies come into clearer focus. That said, elections tend to force voters to think in this all-or-nothing way. Either you vote for a Democrat or for a Republican. Either you vote to re-elect your incumbent or you choose the challenger.Seen through that political lens, these poll numbers are extremely problematic for Democrats on the ballot this fall. We know that, historically, the first midterm election of a president\\'s term is a referendum on his time in office up to that point. The Point: If the public\\'s report card on Biden\\'s second year in office is anything like the one for his first year, Democrats can kiss their House and Senate majorities goodbye.  (CNN)Everywhere you look, the political news is good for Republicans.  President Joe Biden\\'s approval rating is stuck in the low 40s. Thirty House Democrats have already announced their plans to leave office at the end of the term. Republican enthusiasm is soaring. And yet, Mitch McConnell is still nervous.Read More \"People are thinking: Is there any way we can screw this up,\" the Senate minority leader said on Tuesday. \"Well, it\\'s always possible. And so part of my job is to try to prevent us from screwing this up by nominating people for the Senate who can win the primary, but can\\'t win the general.\" He\\'s not wrong! And there\\'s plenty of relatively recent history McConnell can point to as evidence of the dangers of picking the wrong nominee. In 2010, Delaware Republicans opted for an unknown conservative named Christine O\\'Donnell rather than longtime GOP politician Mike Castle as their nominee. O\\'Donnell, who infamously ran an ad declaring that she was \"not a witch,\" lost to Democratic Sen. Chris Coons by a large margin in the general election. Two years later, Missouri Republicans chose then-Rep. Todd Akin as their nominee. Akin quickly disqualified himself with comments about \"legitimate rape.\" Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill won the general election easily. Missouri -- past and present -- is likely on McConnell\\'s mind these days. With Republican Sen. Roy Blunt retiring, the current polling frontrunner in the race is former Gov. Eric Greitens.The problem? Greitens resigned under pressure in 2018 after acknowledging an extramarital affair and facing allegations of blackmail, which he denied. \"It is not conservative to tie a woman up in your basement and assault her,\" said Rep. Vicky Hartzler, who is also running for the seat, referring to Greitens\\' scandal. (Greitens told CNN in a recent interview that he did \"absolutely\" nothing wrong.)  Republicans have expressed concern that if Greitens is their Senate nominee, they could well lose a seat that, based on recent presidential voting patterns, should be an easy hold for them. But many of those same Republicans admit that they may not be able to stop Greitens from winning. While Missouri is clearly the stickiest wicket for McConnell -- and Republicans more generally -- contested primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina all present some level of political peril for the likes of McConnell, depending on who the party chooses to nominate. Looming over all this is former President Donald Trump, who has made clear that he plans to be actively involved in the 2022 primary season. Trump and McConnell are already on opposite sides of the Alaska Senate race, for instance, with McConnell supporting Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Trump backing challenger Kelly Tshibaka. The Point: Things looks very good for McConnell and Senate Republicans. But Trump and the GOP base voters who are loyal to him represent a massive x-factor that could badly complicate the party\\'s math.  (CNN)Members of sports team families and business leaders are among those pouring their personal fortunes into campaigns for office in 2022, making an early impact on primary contests for key midterm races. In Ohio alone, four self-funding candidates have already combined to contribute nearly $30 million to their US Senate campaigns.   Mike Gibbons, a Cleveland-based businessman who made his fortune in real estate and investment banking, has loaned his campaign over $11 million. Matt Dolan, a state senator whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, has directly contributed about $8 million to his campaign, and loaned it $2.5 million more.   Bernie Moreno, a car dealer turned tech executive, loaned his campaign about $3.75 million before suspending his bid this month. And former state GOP chair Jane Timken, whose family owns a Canton-based steel company, has loaned her campaign about $3.5 million.  The flood of money has produced a deluge of advertising in the competitive Republican Senate primary in Ohio. Through the second week of February, Buckeye State voters had already seen over $15 million worth of TV ads. Nearly $10 million more has been reserved through the date of the primary, still months away on May 3. Read MoreRepublican Senate candidates echo lie that 2020 election was stolen in advertisingAnd Ohio isn\\'t the only state where self-funding candidates are influencing key Senate primaries.   In Arizona, Republican Jim Lamon -- whose energy company was purchased by Koch Industries last year -- has loaned his campaign $8 million. In Pennsylvania, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz has already loaned his campaign for the GOP nomination more than $5 million. As in Ohio, millions worth of TV ads have aired already in both states, driven in large part by the spending of these self-funding candidates.   Self-funding in 2022 is not a strictly partisan phenomenon. In Wisconsin, Democratic Senate hopeful Alex Lasry, whose family owns the Milwaukee Bucks NBA franchise, has loaned his campaign nearly $2.4 million. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who is also seeking the Democratic Senate nod in Wisconsin, has invested almost $1.8 million into her bid.   Other candidates have turned to outside spending and wealthy benefactors to keep pace. J.D. Vance, a best-selling author also running for the Republican Senate nomination in Ohio, has loaned his campaign just $100,000. But a super PAC supporting his bid, Protect Ohio Values, received over $10 million last year from GOP megadonor Peter Thiel. Fourth quarter takeaways: Vulnerable Democrats and GOP groups build big war chests, George W. Bush weighs inSeveral House candidates have contributed big sums to their campaigns this election cycle. In Florida, Democrat Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a home health care executive who won a special election for the 20th Congressional District last month, loaned her campaign nearly $6 million (and has repaid herself about $2 million of that total.) Cody Reynolds, a Democratic candidate for Oregon\\'s 6th district, reported loaning his campaign $2 million. And Elijah Norton, a Republican mounting a primary challenge to incumbent Rep. David Schweikert in Arizona, has loaned his campaign about $2 million as well.  Advertising advantageThe ability to pour millions directly into one\\'s own campaign is a significant advantage for these self-funding candidates. Candidate campaigns receive preferential TV advertising rates compared with outside groups like super PACs, which means the money goes further when it comes from a campaign versus an outside group.  \"While money doesn\\'t buy outcomes, it certainly buys advertisements, and to the first consumer of those advertisements, they don\\'t know who\\'s paying for the ad,\" said Sarah Bryner, a strategist at the watchdog group OpenSecrets. The proliferation of self-funders can harm lesser-known candidates who aren\\'t independently wealthy from breaking through, Bryner added. Though these self-funders may not ultimately win their respective contests, they can blunt momentum for their rivals early on by crowding out the field. Self-funding candidates also make the case that their wealth affords them political independence and that they aren\\'t reliant on special interests or megadonors who could influence their positions. Former President Donald Trump made this argument central to his presidential primary campaign in 2015.   \"I\\'m using my own money. I\\'m not using the lobbyists. I\\'m not using donors. I don\\'t care. I\\'m really rich,\" the former President said when he announced his White House bid. Trump ultimately contributed or loaned over $66 million to his 2016 campaign but contributed nothing to his 2020 reelection coffers.  Some high-profile failuresWhile self-funded campaigns enjoy some considerable advantages, they\\'ve had a mixed record at the polls. Michael Bloomberg spent over $1 billion on his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, blanketing national airwaves with advertising. But he failed to win a single state nominating contest. One of his opponents in that race, billionaire Tom Steyer, spent about $350 million, to similar results.   \"They come in. They make a big splash, buy a lot of advertising. It\\'s all paid for by their own money. And it doesn\\'t really move the needle with the polling,\" said Bryner. More recently, Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler loaned her 2020 campaign $23 million, but she was ultimately defeated in a special election runoff by the grassroots-funded effort of Democrat Raphael Warnock.    Whether self-funders win or lose, their ability to pour money into elections can have adverse effects for less wealthy candidates -- crowding out contenders, driving up advertising costs, and raising the barrier to entry for those lacking millions of dollars to spend on politics.  But Democrat Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin\\'s lieutenant governor who is also running for Senate, said he doesn\\'t see the self-funders as a threat because his large grassroots coalition has helped him raise a significant amount of small-dollar donations -- campaign finance reports show he raised $972,000 in donations under $200 through December 31. Barnes said the average donation to his campaign is about $46 out of nearly 50,000 individual donations, many of them from teachers. \"Our small-dollar donors from across the state more than make up for the fact that I\\'m not able to afford to self-fund this race,\" he said.   (CNN)Most polls you\\'re looking at right now are likely underestimating Republicans\\' position heading into the midterm election cycle. It\\'s not that the polls are \"wrong.\" Rather, it\\'s that most polls at this point are asking all registered voters who they\\'re going to vote for in November, when it\\'s likely only a distinct subset of voters who will cast a ballot. The voters who will actually turn out for the fall election are likely going to be disproportionately Republican based on current polling data and history. Take a gander at our CNN/SSRS poll from last week. It featured a rather close race when all registered voters were asked who they would vote for if the election for Congress was held now. The generic Republican candidate garnered 44% to the generic Democratic candidate\\'s 43% -- a result well within the margin of error. This poll is basically in line with the average of all polls, which has generally featured a low single digit Republican advantage on the generic ballot. If that held through November, Republicans would be small favorites to take back the House. Democrats winning the House popular vote and holding on to control given how redistricting has gone (relatively well for Democrats) would be quite plausible.The election is still well over half a year away and we obviously don\\'t know who will turn out in November -- hence, why we are not whittling down the electorate just yet.  Read MoreDig into the poll a little more, and you can see where Democrats\\' problem lies, though. Our CNN poll asked respondents how enthusiastic they were about voting in this year\\'s election \"extremely, very, somewhat, not too or not enthusiastic at all.\"Among those who said they were extremely enthusiastic (24%), Republicans held a 59% to 39% lead over Democrats on the generic congressional ballot. If we expand our universe to include those who were very enthusiastic as well (43% of all voters) of all voters, Republicans were ahead 55% to 42%. No matter how you measure enthusiasm, the voters who are most enthusiastic about voting this year lean Republican. A similar signal was seen in an NBC News poll last month in which Republicans registered far more interest in the upcoming midterms than Democrats, so this poll is no outlier. Of course, a vote cast by an enthusiastic voter is worth the same as a vote cast by an unenthusiastic voter. The fact is, though, that enthusiastic voters have been more likely to say they\\'ll cast a ballot than unenthusiastic voters, at least in CNN polling historically. The relationship isn\\'t perfect, but it\\'s clear one exists. In the final poll before the last midterm in 2018, voters were asked the enthusiasm question as well as how likely they were to vote on a scale from definitely not to definitely will/already have. Among those who said they were extremely enthusiastic to vote, 96% said they were definitely going to vote or had already voted. A relatively low 73% of those who were not extremely likely to vote said they were definitely voting or had already voted. This dropped to 64% among those who were not extremely or very enthusiastic. Of course, the exact levels of enthusiasm between the parties could easily differ between now and Election Day. It\\'s also true that the party that has been more enthusiastic about voting at this point in the campaign has been more enthusiastic to vote in the final CNN poll asking about enthusiasm before the midterm. Republicans were more enthusiastic in 2010 and 2014, while Democrats were more enthusiastic in 2018. The party that was more enthusiastic at this point went on to major gains in the November elections.  Indeed, history would need to be upended for there not to be a significant difference between the voting patterns between registered voters and midterm voters who turn out to vote.In a previous story, I examined the difference in party identification between all registered voters and those who actually voted in midterm elections since 1978 in post-election surveys from the ANES and CES. The years in which there was a Republican president (like in 2018), there was a minimal difference in the party identification between midterm voters and voters overall. In years in which there was a Democratic president (like right now), Republicans on average made up 5 points more of the midterm voter pool than registered voter pool. In none of the years with a Democratic president did Republican turnout advantage shrink below 3 points. Averaging across different national pre-election generic ballot polls in both 2010 and 2014, we see how this impacted the result. The Republican lead widened by about 5.6 points and 4.8 points on average in 2010 and 2014 respectively. In other words, it was very close to what we\\'d expect given what the ANES and CES signaled. Could 2022 be different? Past isn\\'t always prologue, but history does seem more likely than not to repeat itself. Beyond the polling we have nationally right now, the polling ahead of the Virginia gubernatorial election a few months ago painted a similar picture. Fox and the Washington Post, two national pollsters, who presented registered and likely voter results in that race found Republican Glenn Youngkin doing 5 points better on average with likely than registered voters. He would go on to win the election. Anyway you look at it, Democrats are probably in considerably worse shape at this point than polls of registered voters on the generic ballot might lead you to believe.   (CNN)Control of both chambers of Congress and dozens of governorships and state offices are on the line in 2022, the first national election since President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump, who is using the campaign to tighten his grip on the Republican Party.Democrats are on the defensive in Washington, where they face an uphill battle to maintain or grow their narrow majorities in the House and Senate. Republicans, meanwhile, believe they are well-positioned to capitalize on frustration over the ongoing pandemic and bring divided government to the US Capitol in 2023.As the primary calendar heats up, both parties are also poised for intense internal fights over their political directions.Democrats are in the midst of a familiar but pointed debate between rival party factions that has been crystallized by the party\\'s failure, so far, to pass the centerpiece of Biden\\'s agenda.  The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022For Republicans, the stakes are different -- and, in many ways, much higher.Read MoreIn GOP nominating contests across the country, up and down the ballot, the usual issues are largely taking a backseat to basic questions about democracy and whether the Republicans candidates are willing to acknowledge Trump\\'s 2020 loss and to defend the democratic process.The first round of primaries begin on March 1 in Texas. Nominees will be decided in big contests on May 3, when Ohio goes to the polls, and two weeks later as Pennsylvania and North Carolina vote: All three states, like Alabama (May 24), Missouri (August 2) and Vermont (August 9) are going to fill open Senate seats.There will also be an unusual amount of attention paid this year to state legislative races. Even below key contests for governor and statewide offices like attorney general and secretary of state -- the winners of which will have a large role in running the next presidential election -- local elections in 2022 could determine the future of democracy for a generation.Some of these dates will change as the redistricting process continues.MarchTuesday, March 1TexasAprilTuesday, April 5CA-22 special primaryMayTuesday, May 3IndianaOhioTuesday, May 10NebraskaWest VirginiaTuesday, May 17IdahoKentuckyOregonPennsylvaniaNorth CarolinaTuesday, May 24AlabamaArkansasGeorgiaTexas (runoff) JuneTuesday, June 7CaliforniaIowaMississippiMontanaNew JerseyNew MexicoSouth DakotaCA-22 special general (if necessary)Tuesday, June 14MaineNevadaNorth DakotaSouth CarolinaTuesday, June 21District of ColumbiaVirginiaAlabama (runoff)Arkansas (runoff)Georgia (runoff)Tuesday, June 28ColoradoIllinoisMarylandNew YorkOklahomaUtahMississippi (runoff)South Carolina (runoff)JulyTuesday, July 26North Carolina (runoff)AugustTuesday, August 2ArizonaKansasMichiganMissouriWashingtonThursday, August 4TennesseeTuesday, August 9ConnecticutMinnesotaVermontWisconsinSaturday, August 13HawaiiTuesday, August 16AlaskaWyomingSouth Dakota (runoff)Tuesday, August 23FloridaOklahoma (runoff) SeptemberTuesday, September 6MassachusettsTuesday, September 13DelawareNew HampshireRhode IslandNovemberTuesday, November 8Election DayLouisiana (open primaries) DecemberTuesday, December 6Georgia runoffs Saturday, December 10Louisiana runoffs   (CNN)There\\'s nothing like a Supreme Court vacancy to get people in Washington talking about the Senate.  It\\'s less clear, however, whether the voters who will decide control of the Senate nine months from now are attuned to that conversation, especially since the ideological makeup of the court is not in the balance.  Justice Stephen Breyer\\'s decision to retire came as President Joe Biden\\'s approval rating stood at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to CNN\\'s average of six recent national polls. The best scenario for Democrats is that the vacancy and Biden\\'s pledge to nominate a Black woman will help drive base enthusiasm and remind moderates who care about abortion rights, for example, of what\\'s at stake in the battle for the Senate. But that may be a lot of theoretical dot-connecting for most Americans preoccupied with high prices at the pump and the checkout line.  Still, the seat most likely to flip partisan control is the place where Democrats see the Supreme Court vacancy as having perhaps the biggest impact. That\\'s not a new development: Pennsylvania has led the list since CNN started ranking the 2022 races nearly a year ago. But it speaks to the demographics Democrats need to turn out in the Keystone State -- their urban base and suburban voters.  The ranking is based on CNN\\'s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. Fundraising reports for the fourth quarter of 2021, which were due to the Federal Election Commission by Monday, showed some Democrats raising massive sums of money, while some Republican candidates poured significant personal wealth into their campaigns. As the year progresses, more polling and advertising spending data will become bigger factors in the ranking.  \\nRead MoreWhile Pennsylvania still leads the list, Republicans are feeling more confident about the seat, which GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is vacating, than they have in months, thanks to some new candidates. But it remains a question, as is the case in several other races, how much embracing former President Donald Trump in the primary comes back to haunt the eventual GOP nominee in the general election in a state Biden won in 2020.  As he resumes his campaign-style rallies, with a heavy focus on his 2020 election lies, Trump is signaling that he won\\'t be sitting 2022 out quietly, even if he\\'s not on the ballot. The jockeying for his support has already led to massive spending -- especially in Pennsylvania, where the GOP primary has attracted $18 million, mostly in December and January alone, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.  \"I still say it\\'s 50-50,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN\\'s Manu Raju last week about the GOP\\'s chances of flipping the chamber. The Kentucky Republican backed the bipartisan infrastructure law, one of Biden\\'s biggest achievements to date, but he\\'s standing in the way (along with two moderate Democrats) of the President\\'s other priorities, such as his social spending and climate change plan and voting rights legislation, both of which stalled in the Senate.  Trump team announces $122 million war chestVulnerable Democratic incumbents on this list -- Sens. Mark Kelly, Catherine Cortez Masto, Maggie Hassan and Raphael Warnock -- all voted in favor of eliminating the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. While taking that position has become a new litmus test of sorts in Democratic primaries (again, see Pennsylvania), and some Republicans are attacking Democrats over it, it\\'s far from clear that the fate of the 60-vote threshold is a salient issue for American voters. There\\'s been plenty of effort to get voters\\' attention. Candidates and outside groups have already spent twice as much on TV and radio ads as they had at similar points in the 2018 and 2020 cycles, according to a CNN analysis of AdImpact data.   Look for that spending to increase quickly ahead of spring primaries, with the first big Senate contest of the year (Ohio) happening on May 3. Until then, stay tuned for more updates to this ranking. Here are the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip as of this month:  1. PennsylvaniaIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)Pennsylvania remains the seat most likely to flip, although Republicans feel better about holding retiring Sen. Pat Toomey\\'s seat now that the Trump-backed candidate is out of the race and several new candidates have jumped in. \"We have an embarrassment of riches,\" McConnell told Raju in late January. The biggest new name is hedge fund executive David McCormick. A former Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration who lived in Connecticut for years, McCormick has rolled out ads trying to convince voters that \"his Pennsylvania roots will keep him grounded.\" He\\'s the husband of Dina Powell McCormick, who was Trump\\'s deputy national security adviser. Sean Parnell, the Trump endorsee who suspended his campaign after a public custody battle that was generating worrisome headlines for the GOP, quickly backed McCormick, as did Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who recently rallied with him in the state. McCormick and his allies are already in a sniping contest with Dr. Mehmet Oz, who entered the race late last fall and had loaned his campaign more than $5 million, according to his recent FEC filing. Honor Pennsylvania, an anti-Oz group, is attacking the former talk show host as a \"Hollywood liberal.\" (Like McCormick, Oz recently lived out of state, in New Jersey.) American Leadership Action, a pro-Oz group, is going after McCormick\\'s business record, as is Oz\\'s campaign. There were already Republicans running here -- allies of businessman Jeff Bartos, for example, are attacking the two newcomers as carpetbaggers -- and Carla Sands, who was ambassador to Denmark under Trump, loaned her campaign another $500,000 in the fourth quarter. While Democrats are enjoying watching Republicans duke it out, they have their own crowded primary. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is still the fundraising leader, raising $2.7 million in the fourth quarter. Rep. Conor Lamb -- who, like Fetterman, is from the western part of the state -- has picked up some labor endorsements and the backing of the mayor of Philadelphia. He finished ahead of the other candidates in a state party committee vote last weekend but fell short of the threshold for an endorsement. 2. GeorgiaIncumbent: Democrat Raphael WarnockAfter winning a special election runoff last winter that helped flip the Senate, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock never slowed down. He raised $9.8 million in the fourth quarter as he seeks a full six-year term in November. Only a sum like that could make the nearly $5.4 million that Republican challenger Herschel Walker raised seem paltry. Since Biden won the state in 2020, Georgia has remained one of the most interesting political battlegrounds that\\'s also home to a high-profile gubernatorial race and is ground zero for the fight for voting rights, which Democrats hope could energize turnout on their side. With the national spotlight on his state, Warnock isn\\'t likely to be hurting for money anytime soon. And while staggering Democratic fundraising hasn\\'t always translated to success (see South Carolina in 2020 or Texas in 2018), public polling suggests this race is competitive. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed no clear leader, with Walker at 49% and Warnock at 48% among registered voters. Republicans are feeling confident about this race now that McConnell and Trump are united behind Walker, even if the former NFL star remains largely untested as a candidate, and because the national environment has looked increasingly strong for them. Biden\\'s job approval rating in the Peach State in that Quinnipiac poll, for example, was 36%. But Democrats take heart that Warnock\\'s job approval was a higher 47%. With Senate races so nationalized these days, Warnock will need to continue to overperform Biden -- as he did in 2021 -- if he\\'s going to survive in November, regardless of how many millions he raises.  3. WisconsinIncumbent: Republican Ron JohnsonThe big news here is GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is running for reelection, which reassured Republicans and enthused Democrats. Republicans are glad to be avoiding another messy primary, and they\\'re thankful Johnson didn\\'t wait even longer to make his announcement. In a video explaining his decision, Johnson says he intended for his current term to be his last but cannot \"walk away\" after seeing \"the Democrats in total control.\" Democrats, however, are thrilled that Johnson -- who has continued to make controversial and misleading statements about Covid-19 and January 6 -- is running. They believe he\\'s a damaged enough incumbent that it will be easier to flip this seat with him in it than if he weren\\'t. Senate Majority PAC, the preeminent Democratic super PAC, quickly attacked Johnson for being \"deep in the swamp.\" Johnson\\'s announcement also prompted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to launch its first TV ad of the cycle, hitting him for \"looking out for himself.\" Republicans think a strong national environment will help them hold on to this seat, especially if they can paint the eventual Democratic nominee as too far left for the state, which backed Biden by less than a point in 2020. They\\'re excited about the prospect of running against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, for example, who has the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Barnes raised $1.2 million in the fourth quarter -- which is more than Johnson\\'s $711,000 but lower than some Democratic challengers across the country. And he faces a crowded primary, including Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who loaned his campaign about $1.5 million in the fourth quarter and has been running a series of ads on TV.  4. ArizonaIncumbent: Democrat Mark KellyDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, like Warnock in Georgia, continues to post impressive fundraising numbers as he runs for a full six-year term in November. Kelly raised nearly $9 million in the last quarter. That, on its own, should put Republicans on notice in an increasingly purple state that Biden narrowly won in 2020. But unlike Georgia, where the GOP has largely coalesced around one candidate, Republicans here face a real headache with a messy candidate field ahead of the August primary. There have been renewed rumors about Gov. Doug Ducey running, which would please McConnell and national Republicans, but he\\'s a frequent target of Trump and doesn\\'t appear to have made any moves ahead of the April filing deadline. That leaves Attorney General Mark Brnovich, whose fundraising continues to be underwhelming (he raised about $800,000 last quarter) and venture capitalist Blake Masters, among several others, duking it out. Masters raised nearly $1.6 million, but he also has the advantage of a Peter Thiel-backed super PAC touting him as a \"Trump conservative.\" Based on the advertising in the state -- which has already crept past $30 million, according to CNN\\'s analysis of AdImpact data as of Friday -- Republicans are leaning into the Trump loyalty contest. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon, for example, who loaned his campaign $3 million in the fourth quarter, is going all-in on Trump\\'s claims of a rigged election. Regardless of their nominee, Republicans think it\\'s a winnable race, especially if the national environment continues to look bleak for Biden and other Democrats, and they\\'re eager to go after Kelly\\'s voting record and exploit the differences between him and his more moderate Democratic Arizona colleague, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.  5. NevadaIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez MastoThis is one of the few contests, like Georgia, where Trump and McConnell have already united behind the same candidate. In Nevada, it\\'s former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name. The GOP\\'s ability to coalesce around him ahead of the June primary could be critical to winning the seat, but he still faces competition. Retired Army Capt. Sam Brown raised about $1 million in the fourth quarter, just shy of Laxalt\\'s $1.3 million. Republicans are hopeful that Biden\\'s sagging approval ratings and voters\\' anxieties will help them in the state, which has seen its share of pandemic and inflation woes. \"I don\\'t know if it\\'s the President, or what happened, but (under Trump) it was so much better,\" one Nevada voter who has recently voted for Democrats told CNN\\'s Maeve Reston in early January. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the former chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised about $3.3 million last quarter and hasn\\'t yet really reintroduced herself to voters. Democrats have long believed that abortion could be a salient issue here -- especially since Laxalt\\'s opposition to abortion rights puts him at odds with the state\\'s most recent GOP governor -- and are hoping the Supreme Court vacancy will help bring more attention to that contrast by reminding voters what\\'s at stake. But Republicans\\' inroads with Hispanics, combined with the state\\'s non-college-educated White population, make this race among the most competitive.  6. North CarolinaIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)Trump\\'s endorsement in this race nearly eight months ago has yet to clear the GOP field, with none of the candidates posting stellar fundraising. In fact, former Rep. Mark Walker announced last week that he would carry on with his Senate campaign rather than drop down to a House race with the possibility of an endorsement from the ex-President. Rep. Ted Budd, Trump\\'s pick for Senate, raised $968,000 in the fourth quarter and continues to introduce himself to voters statewide, while the Club for Growth\\'s political arm spends big to help him. That includes going hard after former Gov. Pat McCrory, who raised $748,000. Combat veteran Marjorie K. Eastman raised $423,000 and is less well known but has benefited from nearly $1 million in outside spending from a group called Restore Common Sense. The delay in the state\\'s primaries from March to May, thanks to redistricting litigation, will give Republicans more time to sort out their field. Democrats, meanwhile, have a prohibitive favorite in former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley after other major candidates dropped out. She raised $2.1 million in the last quarter. While Republicans likely start with the advantage in this state that Trump carried by about a point in 2020, Democrats are hopeful Beasley can energize minority turnout in a non-presidential year.  7. New HampshireIncumbent: Democrat Maggie HassanDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan got a huge break when Republican Gov. Chris Sununu decided late last year to run for reelection rather than challenge her. Besides retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, several other Republicans are now hoping to take on Hassan, although none of Sununu\\'s stature. Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP gubernatorial nod in 2012, announced his campaign last month. State Senate President Chuck Morse followed over the weekend, riding a skid-steer loader into his snowy announcement event, WMUR reported. McConnell singled out Morse in his interview with CNN last week, saying, \"We think we\\'ll have a good candidate there.\" Democrats have done well in the Granite State in recent federal elections, with Biden carrying the state by 7 points in 2020. But his approval rating slipped last fall, giving Republicans hope they\\'d unseat Hassan even without their preferred candidate. Biden\\'s numbers had somewhat improved by mid-December, returning to July levels, according to the most recent University of New Hampshire Granite State Poll. Hassan, who raised $3.2 million in the last quarter, isn\\'t in as competitive a race as she could have been had Sununu thrown his hat in the ring, but she still has to hope that the national environment doesn\\'t endanger her. Only 28% of New Hampshire residents in that Granite State Poll, for example, said things in the US \"are headed in the right direction.\"  8. Florida Incumbent: Republican Marco RubioGOP Sen. Marco Rubio is running for a third term in a state that has favored Republicans recently. (Trump carried it by 3 points in 2020.) That means he starts as the favorite, but Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who was a contender for Biden\\'s running mate, has been an impressive fundraiser. She raised about $7.2 million in the fourth quarter -- more than Rubio\\'s $5.2 million, although he ended 2021 with more cash on hand. Demings will need the money to introduce herself statewide across expensive media markets. Rubio has recently been touting his support from law enforcement, trying to counter any advantages Demings might bring to the race as a former Orlando police chief. The congresswoman responded last week by calling Rubio a \"lifelong politician,\" saying that during her tenure with the police she had helped respond to \"some dark, scary places\" while he was \"home in his bed sleeping,\" according to the South Florida Sun Sentinel. 9. OhioIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)The Republican primary field to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman remains unsettled ahead of the May primary as candidates and their allies frantically put out polls to try to shape their own narratives of the race. The Club for Growth\\'s political arm is spending for former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, attacking \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance and former state party Chair Jane Timken. Almost all the candidates, including a couple of big-spending businessmen, are leaning heavily into Trump\\'s rhetoric, creating a sharp distinction from the senator they\\'re hoping to succeed. Vance claimed in a tweet thread on the anniversary of the US Capitol insurrection that many of the rioters in a DC jail are \"political prisoners,\" adding, \"They are our people.\" He also recently secured the endorsement of controversial GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, which he likely hopes will blunt some of his past public criticism of Trump. State Sen. Matt Dolan was the rare candidate to describe January 6 as \"an attack on American democracy\" in a statement on the one-year anniversary, calling out \"fake conservatives willing to sacrifice our most sacred text, the Constitution, in favor of political expedience.\" He\\'s invested a stunning $10.5 million of his own money into his campaign (mostly in contributions, not loans) but faces a steep uphill battle in a GOP primary that revolves around Trump. On the Democratic side, Rep. Tim Ryan, who raised $2.9 million last quarter, has largely consolidated support, but Ohio, which Trump carried by 8 points, remains a tough state for anyone in his party who\\'s not Sen. Sherrod Brown. 10. MissouriIncumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring)Missouri is different from most of the states on this list in that it really wouldn\\'t be here if it weren\\'t for one man. \"Missouri is potentially challenging depending on the outcome in the primary,\" McConnell told Raju. Former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct, threatens to put in play a red state that Trump won by 15 points in 2020. He\\'s trying to align himself with Trump, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fiancée of the ex-President\\'s son, is his campaign\\'s national chair. Greitens faces a handful of Republicans also trying to secure Trump\\'s support ahead of the August primary. Rep. Billy Long, for example, ran an ad about Democrats \"rigging the election.\" State Attorney General Eric Schmitt recently announced lawsuits against school districts with masking rules, which is becoming a conservative rallying cry as the third year of the pandemic gets underway. GOP Rep. Vicky Hartzler -- the only woman in the race -- hasn\\'t hesitated to go after Greitens, taking an implicit jab at his extramarital affair in her first ad released last fall. The fear is that Greitens could jeopardize the general election much like GOP nominee Todd Akin did in the 2012 Senate contest. And the more Republicans in the race, the more splintered the primary vote will be, thereby lowering the threshold Greitens would need to win the nomination. Democrat Lucas Kunce raised $710,000 in the fourth quarter -- more than any of the Republicans excluding personal loans. But the Marine veteran will need more than money to make the race go his way.

If a congressional seat is safe from any real competition on Election Day, what incentive remains for a member of Congress to negotiate with the opposing party to actually accomplish something?Read MoreWe\\'ve turned to three in-house experts who are following the issue closely -- Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo, who are producers for CNN\\'s Political Unit, and CNN Politics\\' justice writer Tierney Sneed -- to explain redistricting and to give CITIZEN BY CNN readers the latest developments.Here\\'s Ethan and Melissa:Who draws the maps? When redistricting works like it\\'s supposed to, congressional district maps are drawn by either state lawmakers or by state redistricting commissions. But like many best-laid plans, that\\'s not what has happened in every state. Courts have had to draw or choose the maps in six states, either because the normal processes failed to produce a plan (usually when control of state government is split between the parties) or because the produced maps failed to comply with legal standards.  Where do things stand today with redistricting? Is it over yet? We\\'re about eight months from Election Day and the redistricting process still isn\\'t finished, delayed in part by the pandemic-driven late release of the census data required.  Four states -- Florida, Missouri, New Hampshire and Louisiana -- still have yet to enact their final maps. In all four of those states, congressional maps are passed just like other legislation. Republicans have full control of state government in the first three states, but they haven\\'t passed maps amid intra-GOP disputes about how aggressively to draw the lines.  In Louisiana, the state legislature recently passed a new map, but Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards hasn\\'t announced whether he\\'ll sign it. And as litigation over newly drawn maps continues across the country, it\\'s possible maps in other states will need to be revised as well.  What\\'s been the biggest surprise about redistricting? Republicans control most state legislatures across the country, so going into this redistricting process, a lot of analysts believed the GOP would be able to benefit significantly from new maps -- especially since the party is trying to regain control of the House in November.  But Democrats have had legal victories in states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina that resulted in more favorable maps. Democrats have also been able to utilize their advantage in states like New York, where they control the redistricting process.  They now have a chance to come out better than expected, and perhaps even benefit from the new maps overall.   However, Democrats still face an uphill climb to hold the House this November as they deal with President Joe Biden\\'s low approval numbers and the historic trend of poor midterm performance from the party that controls the White House.  Two of the strangest terms to arise about drawing congressional maps are \"cracking\" and \"packing.\" What do they mean and how do they work?In the simplest terms, \"cracking\" and \"packing\" are two ways congressional map-drawers gerrymander districts. Cracking is when mapmakers weaken a particular group\\'s influence by spreading those voters throughout several districts. And packing is when specific voters are forced into one district, or as few districts as possible, to condense their influence.  Tennessee Republicans gave us a good idea of what cracking looks like this year. For most of Tennessee\\'s history, Nashville has been in one congressional district. And for most of modern political history, in a sea of deep-red Tennessee, Nashville\\'s district consistently sent Democrats to Congress. But this year, Republicans in the state divided Davidson County, where Nashville is, into three congressional districts that are paired with more conservative and rural parts of the state. That split, or crack, will weaken the influence of the more liberal Nashville population.  It also should be noted that Republicans aren\\'t the only ones engaged in partisan map drawing. In states like New Mexico, Illinois and New York, Democrats drew lines to benefit their partisan interests. Here\\'s Tierney:Where are the big legal fights happening and what are they about?With each redistricting cycle, the legal fight over partisan advantage in map-drawing seems to get more complicated. And this cycle is no exception. In 2019, the US Supreme Court said that federal courts could not play a role in policing partisan gerrymandering. So, some of the most impactful legal fights this cycle are playing out in state courts, where voters have challenged maps for giving one party too much of an advantage.Federal courts still have the authority to review claims of racial gerrymandering. Depending on the facts on the ground, maps alleged to be racially discriminatory can be challenged under the Voting Rights Act (VRA), under the Constitution or both. However, the Supreme Court has signaled that it may soon scale back the scope of the VRA in redistricting, which would leave voters, political parties and voter rights organizations with even fewer options to challenge unfair maps in court. In the lawsuits that are alleging that the political power of minority voters is being diluted, we are seeing a lot of arguments about how communities of color have grown in places like Texas and Georgia, with cases claiming that the new maps do not adequately reflect that growth. In Texas, for instance, people of color made up 95% of the population growth that led to the state being awarded two additional seats in the US House this decade. Yet both of those districts were drawn to have White voting majorities, as the Justice Department argued in the lawsuit it brought against the state. Americans already have begun to vote in primaries, so how will these court cases affect actual elections?  It depends on the state. In some states, like Texas and Georgia, the current lawsuits won\\'t change the maps before this year\\'s election.  Part of the issue legal challengers have run into is that maps were drawn much later last year than usual. That is because the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the 2020 Census -- which produces the data for each decade\\'s redrawing of maps -- which, in turn, delayed the release date for the data from that survey. In some states, legislators or courts pushed back their electoral calendars because of coronavirus-created time crunch. But we\\'re still seeing the legal fights over the maps run into election deadlines. In Ohio, for example, local election officials and GOP state leaders are sparring over whether to move the May 3 primary date as the redistricting commission has repeatedly seen its maps rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court. Another complication -- particularly in the federal redistricting litigation -- is a recent move by the Supreme Court that has discouraged lower courts from disturbing the maps for this years\\' election, even when those courts think the maps violate the law. Alabama earlier this year had been ordered by two federal courts to redraw its congressional map, after the courts found it likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the political power of Black voters. But at Alabama\\'s request, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, intervened to put that order on hold. The full majority didn\\'t explain its reasoning, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a concurrence that touted a legal principle of avoiding court actions that could cause confusion among voters.Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court\\'s liberal justices, shot back in a dissent: \"Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians\\' voting rights just because the court\\'s order came down in the first month of an election year.\" Already, a district judge in Georgia has cited the Supreme Court\\'s move in Alabama to explain he would not order Georgia to redraw its state legislative maps for its coming elections, even though the judge believes that they violated the Voting Rights Act. Where\\'s the Supreme Court on all of this?  As you may have picked up by now, the Supreme Court -- particularly this current conservative majority -- has generally shown more sympathy to legislators who have drawn potentially unfair or discriminatory maps than they have to the voters seeking to challenge those plans. The Supreme Court\\'s 2015 Shelby County decision set the stage for this trend. In that case, the conservative majority gutted a provision in the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination in voting practices to get federal approval for their redistricting plans (and any other changes to their election policies).Since then, the court majority gave Texas key wins in a redistricting racial discrimination case stemming from the 2010 census cycle. The 2019 partisan redistricting decision, known as Rucho v. Common Cause put an end to any hopes that federal courts could rein in maps aggressively skewed towards one party or another. Though the court hasn\\'t weighed in on the merits of the Alabama case, its willingness to jump in at the preliminary stage it was in suggests the court is going to scale back the Voting Rights Act\\'s reach in redistricting once again, by making it harder for legal challengers to prove that maps can be drawn in way that don\\'t undermine minority voters. However, in a setback for Republicans, the Supreme Court on Monday rebuffed efforts to disturb maps adopted by state courts in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.While the 2022 elections in Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be conducted with redistricting plans less favorable to Republicans, the Supreme Court\\'s conservative wing has signaled an interest in considering a case down the road that would limit the ability of state courts to rein in partisan gerrymanders.You need to readCNN\\'s interactive that explores Census data to show how America has grown more diverse and more multiracial than ever before.Kaanita Iyer\\'s story for CNN on fears that redistricting battles in Alabama and other states will lead to voter suppression.CNN\\'s Steve Contorno\\'s look at GOP Florida Gov.

(CNN)The Supreme Court on Monday night denied requests from Republicans challenging congressional maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania that had been approved by state courts, in two rulings that could benefit Democrats in the midterm elections.The North Carolina congressional map drawn by state judges would likely give Democrats at least another seat in Congress next year. The court -- over the noted dissents of Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch -- turned away an emergency request from Republican legislators to use a different map that would be more favorable to their party. Supreme Court declines to revive Bill Cosby prosecutionFor Pennsylvania, the court rejected an emergency request from a group of six Republican voters who wanted to freeze a ruling from the commonwealth\\'s high court that allowed the maps to take effect and altered the general primary calendar. There were no noted dissents from the two-sentence order.Closely watched caseThe North Carolina case especially had been closely followed by election law experts because lawyers for Republican legislators had asked the Supreme Court to adopt a theory that state courts cannot interpret their own state constitutions when it comes to redistricting and rules related to federal elections.Read MoreThe theory is called the \"Independent State Legislature claim\" in legalese. The Electors Clause of the US Constitution vests \"state legislatures\" with the power to appoint presidential electors \"in the manner\" they choose. The Elections Clause gives them control over the \"Times, Places and Manner\" of holding elections. Under the theory being pushed, \"legislature\" excludes a role for state courts.Judge shuts down January 6-based challenge to Rep. Madison Cawthorn\\'s candidacyIf a majority of the court were ever to adopt those arguments, it could profoundly change the landscape of election law, upending the power of state courts to rely on state laws in disputes over federal elections. The theory attracted some members of the court\\'s right wing in the past during litigation surrounding then-President Donald Trump\\'s quest to use the courts to overturn Joe Biden\\'s presidential election victory.The North Carolina Supreme Court held that the congressional map was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander under North Carolina law, saying that the General Assembly must not \"dilute any individual\\'s vote on the basis of partisan affiliation.\" The congressional maps are \"unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\" under several clauses of the North Carolina Constitution, it added. The state Supreme Court ordered a trial court to prepare new maps.RELATED: Judge shuts down January 6-based challenge to Rep. Madison Cawthorn\\'s candidacyNorth Carolina is divided into 14 congressional districts, having gained an additional seat after the 2020 census due to an increase in the state population.In court papers, lawyers for the legislators said the state Supreme Court\\'s actions \"nullify the North Carolina General Assembly\\'s regulations of the manner of holding federal elections in the State and replaces them with new regulations of the judiciary\\'s design.\" They said the North Carolina Supreme Court\\'s actions \"are fundamentally irreconcilable\" with the federal Constitution.A coalition of voting rights groups, Democratic voters and the state\\'s board of elections urged the US Supreme Court to stay out of the dispute. They said that if the justices were to intervene now it would cause confusion and delay as well as \"severe administrative difficulties.\"After the order, Neal Katyal, a lawyer for the coalition of groups, praised the court\\'s decision. \"By denying this stay, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in line with many precedents that there is no constitutional basis for attempting to rewrite the North Carolina Supreme Court\\'s decision at the 11th hour,\" said Katyal. \"By leaving intact the decision by the North Carolina Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court has paved the way for elections to proceed with the legislative and Congressional maps as ordered by the state courts,\" he added.Conservative dissentsAlito, Thomas and Gorsuch would have ruled in favor of the Republican legislators from North Carolina. They said in their dissent that the case presented an \"exceptionally important and recurring question of constitutional law\" concerning \"the extent of a state court\\'s authority to reject rules adopted by a state legislature for use in conducting federal elections.\" The dissenters said the case at hand had presented a good opportunity to consider the issue, \"but unfortunately the Court has again found the occasion inopportune.\"They said the Republicans will be \"irreparably harmed\" because they will be deprived of their constitutional prerogative to draw the congressional map in their state, and the public interest will be disserved if the 2022 congressional elections in North Carolina are held using districts that the court eventually determines were \"unconstitutionally imposed.\"Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he agreed with his conservative colleagues that the court should eventually take up the issue of the role of state courts. But he did not dissent and said he agreed with the majority in the case at hand to allow the maps to be used for the next election. \"This Court has repeatedly ruled that federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election laws in the period close to an election,\" Kavanaugh wrote.Pennsylvania district fightLawyers for the Republican voters in Pennsylvania had told the justices that \"relief is urgently needed\" because candidates are already campaigning for office under an \"unconstitutional map\" and the statutory deadline for obtaining the needed signatures on nomination petitions falls on Tuesday.Pennsylvania had 18 seats in the US House of Representatives, but the results of the 2020 census left it with one seat fewer due to population shifts. In January, the Republican-led General Assembly approved what the GOP voters argued was a \"reasonable non-gerrymandered map\" that would have created a 9-8 majority of Democratic-leaning congressional districts. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm electionsBut Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf vetoed the map, saying the General Assembly\\'s action \"adopts a map selected by politicians to take advantage of the process and choose their own voters.\"Separately, a group of litigants went to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to impose a map that would have favored Democrats and likely created a 10-7 majority of Democratic-leaning districts. The state Supreme Court ultimately adopted the plan -- dubbed the \"Carter Plan.\"  Lawyers for the commonwealth asked the court to reject Republicans\\' petition, arguing it amounted to an \"invitation to chaos\" by creating an at-large election.\"Petitioners ask the Court to scrap the entire congressional map for Pennsylvania and to order the Commonwealth to hold statewide at-large congressional elections for the first time since the 18th Century,\" Joshua Matz, a lawyer for Pennsylvania, said in court papers.This story has been updated with further details and background.  (CNN)On Monday night, the US Supreme Court rejected Republican-led challenges to congressional district maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, handing Democrats a win in each of the hotly contested states. The Supreme Court\\'s decision effectively cements a huge story that has been under the radar for months now: Democrats are on track to emerge from the decennial redistricting process in FAR better shape than either party expected even a year ago. \"This ruling ensures the 2022 House map will be much less skewed towards Republicans than the current one (and perhaps not skewed towards Rs at all),\" tweeted Dave Wasserman, a nonpartisan redistricting expert and House editor at the Cook Political Report, on Monday night.Read More And Wasserman noted that the news could get even better -- if the Ohio Supreme Court invalidates a Republican plan, it could mean two to three more House seats for Democrats.  All of that follows on a new map unveiled by New York Democrats last month, which could result in a 22-4 Democratic advantage in the state\\'s delegation. (The current split is 19 Democrats, 8 Republicans.) It\\'s a remarkable upsetting of expectations. Heading into the once-a-decade redraw, the conventional wisdom was that Republicans would have a large edge in redistricting -- one they would use to further position themselves to win back the House in 2022. Wrote FiveThirtyEight, a political analysis and projection site, shortly after the 2020 election:  \"Joe Biden may have won the White House, but down-ballot races were much better for Republicans. In fact, the GOP\\'s victories in state-level elections could pay dividends long after Biden leaves office, thanks to their influence over next year\\'s redistricting process.\" The disparity was stark. According to the Cook Political Report, Republicans had full control of the line-drawing process in 20 states that comprised 187 congressional districts, while Democrats had that same full control in just eight states with 75 districts total.So, what happened? The most aggressive Democratic gerrymanders -- like New York and Illinois -- appear to have withstood any potential legal challenges. The same can\\'t be said for similarly over-the-top Republican gerrymanders in places like North Carolina. (For more on this, check out today\\'s CITIZEN by CNN newsletter.)  In other states, deadlocks in the main body charged with drawing the lines handed power to a third-party entity, which favored Democrats. The most obvious and important example of that reality is in Pennsylvania. The state\\'s Supreme Court, where Democrats hold a majority, took control of the line-drawing process last month after the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled legislature deadlocked on a map that must reduce the state\\'s House delegation from 18 seats to 17 seats. The Point: Democrats are still underdogs in their quest to hold the House majority come November -- even with the unexpected redistricting boost. But the map looks less unfriendly to the party than even the biggest Democratic optimists could have imagined a year ago.  (CNN)Florida lawmakers and Gov. Ron DeSantis engaged in a high-stakes game of chicken over the state\\'s new congressional map on Friday, with future control of the US House of Representatives potentially at stake.Over the objections of DeSantis, a Republican who publicly vowed to veto their work, the GOP-controlled House and Senate passed new congressional boundaries Friday that would reshape the political landscape in Florida for the next decade. In an unusual step, state lawmakers approved two maps: one that draws new boundaries to a more Republican advantage and one that is closer to the status quo. If the first map is not approved by the state Supreme Court, then the second safer map would be implemented. The maps now head to DeSantis\\' desk, where the governor made clear Friday on Twitter they were \"DOA.\"\"What makes you think when I say I\\'m going to do something that I\\'m not going to follow through?\" DeSantis said at a news conference in Jacksonville. \"I don\\'t make declarations lightly.\"\"I don\\'t bluff,\" he added.Read MoreThe House passed the maps 67-47, with some Republicans voting against the new boundaries. The Senate vote was 24-15.The showdown over the maps is a rare public power struggle between DeSantis and the Florida Legislature, which has almost always ceded to the governor and his agenda during his tenure in office.DeSantis has urged lawmakers in his party to get behind a much more partisan map, one that could give Republicans the advantage in at least 18 of the 28 districts in the state, and as many as 20. His insistence echoes similar calls from Republican operatives that want to see the GOP press its advantage in hopes of helping the party win a majority in the US House this fall.Florida Republicans currently hold 16 seats in the US House to 11 for the Democrats. The state gained a seat in redistricting and will have 28 House seats for the next decade.But Republican state lawmakers have stood by their work, insisting their maps are constitutionally sound.\"The two-map solution is a creative solution that captures the feedback of all our stakeholders: the public, the members of this chamber and the Governor,\" said state Rep. Tyler Sirois, the chairman of the House Congressional Redistricting Subcommittee. DeSantis, meanwhile, has pushed for lawmakers to break up two of four Black-access districts in what Democrats say is a violation of the Voting Rights Act and the state\\'s Fair District amendment to its constitution.State Sen. Janet Cruz, a Tampa Democrat, said the governor\\'s threats to lawmakers were \"a stain in this whole process.\"JUST WATCHED\\'Ridiculous\\': DeSantis lambasts students for wearing their masks ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\\'Ridiculous\\': DeSantis lambasts students for wearing their masks  00:51DeSantis has inserted himself into the state\\'s once-in-a-decade redistricting process far more than any of his predecessors, even going so far as to submit his own maps for consideration. He has repeatedly said he would veto any map that does not reapportion Florida\\'s 5th Congressional District, a Black plurality seat that stretches across north Florida to connect African American communities in Tallahassee and Jacksonville. The district is represented by Democratic Rep. Al Lawson, who is Black. DeSantis would also break up an Orlando-area district represented by Rep. Val Demings, who is also Black.DeSantis believes Lawson\\'s district represents an unconstitutional gerrymander, even though it was approved by the state Supreme Court last decade.If DeSantis vetoes the maps, then the Legislature could override him with two-thirds of the vote. If state lawmakers cannot come to agreement on a map, then they could kick the fight to the state Supreme Court.Florida is one of four states that have yet to finalize their congressional maps.  (CNN)Now that 31 states have finished redrawing their congressional lines in advance of the 2022 midterm elections, one thing is now abundantly clear: Competitive seats are few and far between.\"Of the 301 new House districts that have now been adopted, just 17 (5.6%) went for [Joe] Biden or [Donald] Trump by five points or less, down from 39 of 301 (13.0%) districts in the same states currently,\" tweeted Dave Wasserman, House editor at the Cook Political Report, on Monday morning. \"Back in 2012, after the last redistricting round, 66/435 districts went for [Barack] Obama or [John] McCain by five points or less.\"That lack of competition is reflected in the ratings offered by nonpartisan handicapping services like the Cook Political Report. As of today, Cook rates just 13 House races as \"toss ups\" and another 17 as \"leaning\" towards one party. Inside Elections, another campaign tip sheet, currently lists a meager 11 House races as pure \"toss ups\" and 14 as either \"tilting\" or \"leaning\" towards one party. That marks a major change from even the 2020 election. According to Cook Political Report calculations, 42 Republicans and 40 Democrats won with 55% or less of the vote that year -- the traditional marker for competitiveness in congressional elections.It also continues a decades-long trend of declining competitiveness as a direct result of the redrawing of the country\\'s 435 congressional districts.

There is a direct connection between the increasing number of purely partisan districts and the decided dearth of bipartisanship in Congress. It creates a disincentive for candidates to do anything other than throw red meat to their bases as the way to win. And it keeps incumbents forever wary of ever working with anyone outside of their party, for fear of being cast as disloyal and losing in a primary.The incentivizing of pure partisans can be seen in the rise of the likes of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan on the right, as well as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib on the left. These are some of the most prominent faces within their respective parties and each one represents a district that would never elect -- or even consider electing -- someone from the other party.Put simply: There are a series of reverberations from drawing congressional districts where only one party has any realistic chance to win. And none of them are good for what people keep telling pollsters they want -- both sides to work together to solve the big problems facing the country.If you want to change the way politics works, you have to change the people you elect. And increasingly, that decision is taken out of the voters\\' hands by the map-drawers who create hundreds of non-competitive districts at the start of every decade.  (CNN)A contentious decision from the US Supreme Court in a Voting Rights Act case from Alabama this week previewed what could be a momentous legal battle over the 1965 law, which over the past several years has been repeatedly whittled down by the conservative justices. After lower courts ordered Alabama to redraw a congressional map that they found diluted the strength of Black voters, the state turned to the Supreme Court with aggressive arguments about the reach of the historic law. Alabama secured a 5-4 ruling on Monday night that will reinstate the disputed map for this year\\'s election. The assertions by Alabama about the role race should play in redistricting are just one of several claims being made by states defending their maps in court that would scale back the scope of the Voting Rights Act --  as Republican-controlled states move to adopt new voting restrictions in key battlegrounds. Some of the GOP states\\' arguments appear to go beyond even what a 6-3 conservative court would be willing to sanction. At stake is the role that a provision of the law known as Section 2 will play in combating racially discriminatory maps going forward. The provision prohibits voting procedures \"not equally open to participation by members\" of a protected class, like racial minorities, and it has been used to strike down maps said to dilute the power of voters of colors. In response to lawsuits filed in various GOP-led states challenging their maps under Section 2, the states have made a litany of arguments that would limit the use of the Voting Rights Act in redistricting cases.\"Republicans are in a mood where they want to throw mud at the wall,\" said Michael Li, a senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center. Read MoreThe Supreme Court did not formally endorse Alabama\\'s claims. Some justices said their votes were driven by how redrawing the map would disrupt Alabama\\'s election planning.\"The court took pains to say that this was not a ruling on the merits, so we will take them at their word,\" former Attorney General Eric Holder, now the head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, told reporters Thursday. \"We will use Section 2 of the Act in other parts of the country.\" Still, even the sole conservative justice to dissent from the move, Chief Justice John Roberts, referenced a \"wide range of uncertainties\" that have arisen in how courts should approach vote dilution claims brought under the Voting Rights Act.  Supreme Court rulings that soften the punch of the act in redistricting could decrease the number of representatives of color in Congress and state legislatures, legal experts say. However, some conservatives have argued that the political shifts in who is electing minority candidates -- with White voters helping to propel several people of color to Congress -- will minimize the impact of such a change in the law. \"This notion that somehow you have to have a majority Black district to elect a Black representative was probably substantially more true in 1965 than it is in 2022,\" said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer. What role should race play in redistricting Voting Rights Act compliance? The arguments Alabama is making are focused on the technical process that courts use to review Voting Rights Act redistricting claims, but they get at the heart of how race should be used as a corrective under the law. If Alabama can convince the Supreme Court to turn away from race consciousness that has historically been deployed in Voting Rights Act vote dilution cases, it will make those cases more difficult for minority voters to bring.  \"This comes down to the question of the role of race in drawing districts,\" Ben Ginsberg, a former Republican redistricting lawyer, told CNN. Under a 1986 Supreme Court precedent in the case Thornburg v. Gingles, redistricting challenges brought under the Voting Rights Act must pass what\\'s commonly known as the Gingles test to get courts to strike down a map. According to the test\\'s first prong, the challengers must prove that there is a relatively compact community of minority voters that could be drawn into a minority-majority district. The second two prongs have to do with racial polarization in voting: Does the minority population vote in a politically cohesive way? And does the racial majority vote as a bloc to defeat the minority voters\\' preferred candidates? The Alabama dispute before the Supreme Court targets the first prong, by digging into a tension between Voting Rights Act compliance and the Supreme Court rulings limiting the use of race in redistricting under the Constitution.  \"The court has made clear that partisan gerrymanders are not justiciable,\" Ginsberg said, referring to the Supreme Court\\'s 2019 decision that said federal courts had no role in policing partisan gerrymanders. \"If [the Alabama dispute] portends a race-blind Voting Rights Act, then that restraint on gerrymandering is gone. That would leave little but state law grounds to stop gerrymanderers from implementing their most creative thoughts.\" Alabama says that under the Voting Rights Act, states should be required to draw majority-minority districts only in circumstances where a race-blind approach to redistricting would have produced those districts. That means challengers could not use race over other redistricting criteria to prove that the first prong of the Gingles test could be met. \"Alabama\\'s proposal would turn the VRA into a race-blind statute that only looks into what this hypothetical race-blind process would produce,\" said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard Law professor who specializes in election law. \"And so the consequence would be just substantially less minority representation in America.\" The approach that Alabama is advocating \"seems to be reverse-engineered to try to make it harder for plaintiffs to win these cases,\" said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at University of California-Irvine. Should the Voting Rights Act apply in redistricting? While Alabama is making complicated arguments to the Supreme Court about the technical approach to complying with the Voting Rights Act, Texas is shooting at the moon with its claims about the act\\'s reach. The Lone Star State signaled in briefs filed in the Justice Department\\'s redistricting case that Texas will argue to the Supreme Court that Section 2 of the act should not apply in redistricting.  Texas already has Justice Clarence Thomas on its side with its claim, as he wrote in a 2017 concurrence and in other cases that he holds that view. That case was heard before former President Donald Trump\\'s three appointees joined the court, so it is unclear whether any of them would join Thomas. Even if they did, that would still leave Texas one justice short of the five votes it would need for a ruling in favor such an argument. Part of what makes Texas\\' argument such a stretch is that it ignores the legislative history of the law, legal experts said. When Congress has renewed the Voting Rights Act in the past, its adjustments to Section 2 have been aimed at how courts should apply it in redistricting. \"If Justice Thomas was right that Section 2 was never intended to apply to redistricting, Congress certainly seemed to think otherwise every time it renewed the act and tweaked the redistricting standards,\" Hasen said. Can private parties bring Voting Right Act claims? A similarly radical argument being made by Texas is that the law does not confer a so-called private cause of action. Texas made the claim in response to the redistricting lawsuit it faces from private civil rights groups challenging its maps. Alabama made the claim as well in earlier stages of its case, but it has abandoned the argument in its appeal to the Supreme Court. If that argument, which was also floated by Georgia in Voting Rights Act redistricting challenges brought there, were endorsed, it would mean that private individuals -- who currently bring the bulk of Section 2 case -- would no longer be able to file such challenges, leaving the law\\'s enforcement to civil suits brought by the Justice Department. Texas and Alabama pointed to a line from Justice Neil Gorsuch\\'s concurrence in the Supreme Court\\'s most recent Voting Rights Act case, where he, joined by Thomas, said it was an \"open question\" whether such a private cause of action exists. Legal experts are deeply skeptical that the argument could gain traction with other justices, given that courts -- up to the Supreme Court -- have routinely heard privately brought Section 2 cases, including the case that produced the Gingles test.\"The idea that none of these lawsuits could ever have been brought because private plaintiffs can sue runs against, like literally, the entire history of Section 2,\" Stephanopoulos said. How should multi-ethnic coalitions configure into Voting Rights Act compliance? Unlike some of the other arguments put forward by GOP states, their claims about how multi-ethnic coalitions should be viewed under the Voting Rights Act would not require the Supreme Court to drastically shift its jurisprudence. States like Texas are arguing that their opponents\\' legal challenges should fail because the challengers are asking for minority-majority districts that would combine racial or ethnic minorities to reach a majority. Many lower courts have OK\\'d Voting Rights Act districts drawn with multi-ethnic coalitions, but some courts haven\\'t. The Supreme Court hasn\\'t yet confronted the question directly and if the justices rejected the use of multi-ethnic coalitions, the \"Supreme Court wouldn\\'t have to adopt total outlier position,\" Stephanopoulos said.In the Texas case, the state is claiming that the Voting Rights Act does not require Texas to create a minority-majority district by combining Black and Hispanic voters, as the challengers are seeking to do in the state.The impact of such a ruling would be less extreme than one that embraced GOP states\\' more sweeping arguments. Coalition districts are already tough to assemble under the Voting Rights Act because, under the Gingles test, those different ethnic groups must exhibit shared political preferences. \"It\\'s not like the court saying, \\'You can\\'t have the rainbow coalition,\\' would affect a lot of districts and would overturn existing understandings,\" Hasen said. \"I think there\\'s just an uncertainty about that.\"   (CNN)The North Carolina Supreme Court on Friday blocked the state\\'s new Republican-drawn congressional and legislative maps, ruling 4-3 that they violate the state constitution.  \"We conclude that the congressional and legislative maps enacted ... are unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt under the free elections clause, the equal protection clause, the free speech clause, and the freedom of assembly clause of the North Carolina Constitution,\" the court wrote in an order.\"To comply with the limitations contained in the North Carolina Constitution which are applicable to redistricting plans, the General Assembly must not diminish or dilute any individual\\'s vote on the basis of partisan affiliation,\" the order continued.\"When, on the basis of partisanship, the General Assembly enacts a districting plan that diminishes or dilutes a voter\\'s opportunity to aggregate with likeminded voters to elect a governing majority-that is, when a districting plan systematically makes it harder for one group of voters to elect a governing majority than another group of voters of equal size-the General Assembly unconstitutionally infringes upon that voter\\'s fundamental right to vote.\"Arizona Republican House speaker effectively dooms GOP bill to allow state legislature to reject election resultsNorth Carolina\\'s new congressional map was passed by its GOP-controlled legislature in November and would likely have helped Republicans gain at least two seats in the state\\'s delegation.Read MoreThe court gave the legislature two weeks to draw new maps and submit them to a lower court, which will select a remedial plan.While the court\\'s four Democrats supported the ruling, the three Republican justices dissented, writing that it \"violates separation of powers by effectively placing responsibility for redistricting with the judicial branch, not the legislative branch as expressly provided in our constitution.\"\"By choosing to hold that partisan gerrymandering violates the North Carolina Constitution and by devising its own remedies, there appears to be no limit to this Court\\'s power,\" Chief Justice Paul Newby wrote for the dissenters.The decision is the latest in a string of positive redistricting developments for Democrats. Courts recently struck down GOP-drawn maps in Ohio and Alabama (the Alabama decision is now before the US Supreme Court), while the Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania Supreme Court just took over the state\\'s process and New York state enacted a map that could net the party several seats in November.Democrats and voting rights advocates hailed the decision.\"A healthy democracy requires free elections and the NC Supreme Court is right to order a redraw of unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts,\" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said in a statement. \"More work remains and any legislative redraw must reflect the full intent of this decision.\"Allison Riggs, co-executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, and one of the lawyers challenging the maps, said in a statement that the ruling was \"an unequivocal win for North Carolina\\'s Black voters who were most harmed by this extreme partisan gerrymander.\"Republican state Sen. Ralph Hise, co-chair of North Carolina\\'s Senate Redistricting Committee, reacted to the decision by criticizing the court itself.\"Democratic judges, lawyers, and activists have worked in concert to transform the Supreme Court into a policymaking body to impose their political ideas,\" he said in a statement.\"This perverse precedent, once set, will be nearly impossible to unwind, as monied interests line up to buy their own justices to set law favorable to them. I\\'m certain Democrats will come to regret it,\" Hise added later.This story has been updated with additional details Friday.  (CNN)New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the state\\'s new congressional map into law Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said, enacting a map that will likely net Democrats several seats in the US House of Representatives in this fall\\'s midterm elections.The Empire State\\'s current delegation includes 19 Democrats and eight Republicans. Because of reapportionment, the state is dropping to 26 seats. Under the new map, as many as 22 of them could favor Democrats. The map was immediately challenged by a group of Republican-aligned voters, who claim in a new lawsuit that the state didn\\'t follow the correct procedure in enacting the map and that it\\'s a partisan gerrymander that violates the state\\'s constitution. How Democrats may actually pull off a *major* redistricting upsetThe legislature took over the redistricting process after the state\\'s bipartisan commission failed to agree on maps.New York is the 30th state to complete congressional redistricting. Fourteen states still need to compete the process, including Alabama and Ohio, where maps were overturned by courts. Six states will have only one congressional district.CNN\\'s Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.  (CNN)The heavily partisan process of redrawing congressional districts ahead of the 2022 elections has resulted in a drop in competitive seats nationwide as the parties in power draw lines to protect their incumbents. But California will stand as a notable exception as the final maps drawn by an independent commission are expected to yield at least seven -- and as many as 10 -- competitive seats as well as a wild scramble for current House members to figure out what districts they will run in.CNN spoke to more than a dozen political strategists, redistricting experts and campaign aides from both parties as California\\'s congressional maps were being revised and refined over the past few weeks to gather their perspectives on how the state\\'s most competitive races are shaping up.The Golden State\\'s redistricting commission approved final maps late Monday night, drawing a total of 52 districts -- one fewer than in the past because of slower population growth. Overall the map still favors Democrats, who hold 42 of the state\\'s current congressional seats, compared to 11 held by Republicans. Independent redistricting panels aim to draw fairer maps but still invite controversyBut Republicans are bullish about their prospects for pickups in 2022 because of the difficult political climate Democrats are facing. In 2020, Republicans flipped four of the state\\'s congressional districts, including the special election win of GOP Rep. Mike Garcia in the 25th District, which covers portions of northern Los Angeles County and is anchored by Santa Clarita. Republican strategist and redistricting expert Matt Rexroad said his assumption is that \"2022 is going to be a very good year for Republicans overall,\" but he noted the GOP may have a more uphill struggle with the new maps in the cycles that follow. \"There\\'s several seats in here that I think are seats that Republicans might even be favored in in 2022, but I don\\'t know how that would look in, like 2028, as they continue to change,\" he said. Read MoreCalifornia\\'s independent commission largely ignored existing congressional lines and the home addresses of the state\\'s politicians, which more partisan processes have been criticized for taking into account, as they created the new maps. After Monday night\\'s initial vote, the commission plans to leave the maps untouched for several days for public review, before giving final approval to the new districts as soon as December 26 and turning the maps over to the secretary of state.But California\\'s battlefield for the 2022 elections is still taking shape, with a complex game of musical chairs expected over the next few weeks. Recent iterations of the maps placed as many as three incumbents in the same district and some of them may leapfrog into different districts if it improves their odds of winning. Members of Congress are not required to reside in the districts where they run, although running outside of their home districts sometimes opens candidates up to attacks on the campaign trail. Democratic Rep. Karen Bass, who is running for Los Angeles mayor, is one of nearly two dozen House Democrats not running for reelection next year. Members of California\\'s delegation account for four of the 23 retirements in the House Democratic Caucus so far, opening up some opportunities for newcomers. Rep. Karen Bass is leaving Congress to run for Los Angeles mayor. Other members heading for the exits include Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard, who represents portions of south and east Los Angeles; Alan Lowenthal who represents Long Beach; and Jackie Speier, who represents southern San Francisco and San Mateo County. Sam Oh, a Republican strategist who is the general consultant for Orange County GOP Reps. Young Kim and Michelle Steel -- two members who won some of the toughest 2020 congressional races in California, predicted that there would be \"a lot of campaign calls over the holidays to discuss every possible option\" on both the Republican or Democratic sides. \"Each campaign will do their due diligence to ensure that whatever seat they run for gives them the best long-term viability,\" Oh said. \"They\\'ll be polling, looking at demographic trends and having very interesting team discussions in the next couple of weeks here as people start announcing for seats.\"A competitive field in Orange CountyCalifornia\\'s redistricting commissioners made major changes to the highly competitive areas of Orange County that will affect the fortunes of Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, as well as Steel, Kim and the Democratic contenders who had been lining up to challenge them.Commissioners essentially drew Porter, Steel and former Rep. Harley Rouda -- the Democrat vying for a rematch with Steel -- into the same seat, creating a long coastal district that encompasses Seal Beach and Huntington Beach to the north, continuing south through Costa Mesa and Newport Beach to an area south of Laguna Beach, while folding in much of the Democratic-leaning city of Irvine, where Porter lives.Porter intends to run in that new 47th District and Democratic strategists view it as a solid opportunity for her given her popularity and huge war chest, and the fact that President Joe Biden won by double digits in that area. But in an unusually pointed statement Wednesday, Rouda said that the new coastal district includes 70% of the area that he represented while serving in Congress between 2018 and 2020 (before he was defeated by Steel). He added that he \"learned via Twitter that Representative Porter has left the district that includes 70% of her constituents, and is now running in my coastal district.\"Rouda said he believes he is the \"most electable Democrat\" in that new district but said that he would spend the holidays with his family and \"evaluate all the options laid before us.\" Porter campaign spokesperson Jordan Wong said she would be running in that district because it \"includes her home city of Irvine, where she lives, and where her three children attend public school.\" But Wong hinted at challenges ahead, noting that \"roughly two-thirds of voters in the 47th District have not previously been represented by Congresswoman Porter\" and said \"she looks forward to introducing herself to these voters and running a positive and spirited campaign, as she did to win close races in 2018 and 2020.\"Rexroad cautioned that no one should count out Republicans in that new district, noting that his analysis shows former Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox won just under 49% of the vote in that area in 2018 and that GOP candidates often overperformed former President Donald Trump in Orange County. Democratic Rep. Katie Porter intends to run in the new 47th District. Though Steel, a first-generation American who immigrated from South Korea as a young adult, lives in that coastal district, she announced Wednesday that she would run in a new Orange County district just to the north that looks more favorable to Republicans. That newly created 45th District encompasses much of Little Saigon, an area with a high concentration of Vietnamese voters where Steel campaigned heavily and did well in 2020.Several GOP strategists noted that Steel has built strong relationships with the diverse Asian communities in areas like Westminster and Garden Grove that are part of that new district and she has deep roots beyond her current district, because of her service on the California State Board of Equalization and as a member of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Nearly 37% of the eligible voters in that district are Asian -- which is on the higher side for southern California -- creating a diverse battlefield for both parties.\"Californians today are facing so many challenges -- from high taxes to concerns over affordability, crime, and the quality of education our children receive,\" Steel said in a statement Wednesday. \"Although the district lines have changed, my mission has not. I have spent my entire career as a public servant fighting to protect California taxpayers, to lower crime rates, and to hold government accountable when it fails the people, and I will continue to do that work.\"Democrat Jay Chen, a small business owner and lieutenant commander in the US Naval Reserves who is one of the party\\'s top recruits, had announced that he would challenge Kim. But he plans to run in the new 45th District, creating a highly competitive matchup with Steel.Kim\\'s current 39th District -- which had encompassed pieces of Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties -- was also sliced and diced under the new lines. She announced Wednesday that she will run in a new, geographically larger inland Orange County district to the south and east, which looks as though it will be far more favorable to Republicans. That new 40th District includes communities that Kim currently represents like Yorba Linda and Chino Hills as well as a large swath of territory in Porter\\'s current district, including parts of Orange and Tustin, continuing farther south through Laguna Hills, Mission Viejo and Rancho Margarita.\"From day one, I have been committed to serving Southern California and that commitment does not change with updated district lines. The out-of-touch policies we see from Nancy Pelosi and Washington politicians are hurting our communities and I\\'ll continue to fight to combat inflation, lower taxes on Californians, and bolster our national security,\" Kim said in a statement. A boost to Latino power in the Central Valley  Three of the most competitive seats in the Central Valley have been those held by Democratic Rep. Josh Harder and Republican Reps. David Valadao and Devin Nunes, who announced earlier this month that he is leaving Congress to head up Trump\\'s social media venture. Under the new lines, territory that had been held by both Nunes and Democratic Rep. Jim Costa ended up in the new 21st District, which is more Democratic than Nunes\\' current seat. Costa announced Tuesday that he will run in that new seat.The commission made some dramatic changes to Harder\\'s seat, essentially splitting it in two with a dividing line in and around the population center of Modesto, where Harder went to high school. But later in the process, the commission spent much of its time trying to boost the percentages of eligible Latino voters in three of the Central Valley districts to increase Latino influence in future elections in keeping with the Voting Rights Act. Democratic Rep. Josh Harder represents one of the most compeitive seats in the Central Valley under the existing map.During that process, Harder\\'s fortunes improved as greater portions of Modesto were added back in to his district, which is the new 13th District. The competitive seat now runs farther south through the Central Valley, sweeping up large portions of Costa\\'s district, which is making it unclear how they will sort out their home turf. Rexroad noted that there may also be an opportunity for the GOP in a newly created 9th District just to the north, which encompasses Stockton and San Joaquin county. Rob Pyers, research director with the California Target Book, a comprehensive guide to the state\\'s political data, noted that the commission essentially moved many Republican voters in the Central Valley into the current district of House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy as they were boosting the influence of Latino voters in other districts, creating more difficult contests for some of McCarthy\\'s neighboring Republicans in 2022.The consolidation of GOP areas made Valadao\\'s district more competitive by a couple of points, Pyers said, by dismembering his Kings County home territory -- where his family farms alfalfa, almonds corn and wheat -- while splitting up the Republican vote in a number of towns and cities.\"The seats objectively get worse for Republicans in the Central Valley versus 2020, but the national environment\" -- which favors the GOP -- \"could counteract that,\" Pyers said.Valadao, who lost his perennial swing seat to Democrat TJ Cox in 2018 and then won it back last year -- will face a tougher race in 2022, both because of the way the commission has drawn the new lines and because he is facing a strong challenge from Democrat Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council, as well as from several others.Redistricting commissioners shifted Valadao\\'s district farther south from an area near Hanford -- where he was born and raised -- so that his new district encompasses less of the areas around Fresno and more of the bluer areas around Bakersfield. Allies of Salas hope that shift will give the Democratic challenger an edge since he is best known in the Bakersfield area.GOP Rep. David Valadao won his seat back in 2020 after being defeated in 2018. But Robert Jones, a Republican strategist who advises Valadao, said the congressman is not daunted by the challenge even if the district ends up looking more Democratic. He noted that Valadao won in 2020 in a district Biden won by about 10 points and has historically done better with Latino voters than other GOP candidates. \"The Hispanic communities are going to be put together in districts that are going to be really competitive (with voters) really evaluating candidates outside of party labels,\" Jones said. \"We win a good share of votes, and have cross-over votes, all over the district. There\\'s no part of the district that we don\\'t compete in, and if it goes a little bit in one direction or another from the current lines, I think we\\'re going to be competitive.\"Swing seats in northern Los Angeles and San Diego countiesThe redistricting commission also made some major changes to the Republican seat held by Garcia, a Santa Clarita native and former Navy fighter pilot. Garcia managed to flip California\\'s current 25th District -- which Republicans had lost in 2018 -- back to the GOP in a 2020 special election after Democrat Katie Hill resigned from Congress amid controversy. Trump endorsed Garcia in that race. In 2022, Garcia is facing a rematch with Democrat Christy Smith, as well as a challenge from Democratic newcomer Quaye Quartey, a former Navy intelligence officer, among others. Smith, a former member of the state assembly, only lost to Garcia by 333 votes in the 2020 general election, underscoring the competitiveness of the area.Garcia faces some challenges under the new lines in what will now be the 27th District. The commission has removed conservative portions of the Simi Valley from his district and added bluer areas of the San Fernando Valley. Despite Garcia\\'s conservative voting record, however, he has not shied away from running in areas that have typically been challenging for Republicans and political observers on both sides believe the seat will remain competitive.GOP Rep. Mike Garcia participates in a ceremonial swearing-in on Capitol Hill in 2020 after flipping a blue seat red in a special election.The most competitive seat in San Diego county will be the coastal district of Democratic Rep. Mike Levin, who also represents part of the southern Orange County coast. Though there were some territory swaps, the redistricting commission appears to have essentially maintained the status quo in San Diego County, preserving two Democratic seats in the city of San Diego and along the San Diego coast that are held by Democratic Reps. Sara Jacobs and Scott Peters, although their residences were drawn into the same district).Republican Rep. Darrell Issa\\'s seat covering parts of East County, San Diego had looked more competitive at various points during the process, but now looks fairly safe for the GOP. A win for voters who sought competition Paul Mitchell, a redistricting expert with the Sacramento-based firm Redistricting Partners, said for all the complaints that have emerged with California\\'s tedious process -- and the line-drawing that unfolded over hundreds over hours on videoconference -- the state\\'s voters will at least have confidence that partisanship did not play a central role.When they passed two ballot measures to create the independent commission in 2008 and 2010, voters \"didn\\'t want politicians drawing districts to advantage political parties and incumbents, and they\\'ve completely won in that regard,\" Mitchell said. \"None of this reflects where politicians want these lines to be drawn. None of this reflects where the political parties want these lines to be drawn.\"\"People might not like where their city is drawn with another city, or they might not like the political implications of the lines,\" he added. \"But they can\\'t say that they don\\'t know why a line was drawn where it was, because it\\'s all done on video.\"This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.   (CNN)The Republican-controlled Florida House on Wednesday night passed a voting overhaul bill that would create a new security office to investigate election crimes and increase penalties for violating the state\\'s elections laws.The legislation would establish a scaled-back version of an elections police force first proposed last year by Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis. The House vote completes legislative action on the measure, which is now headed to DeSantis for his signature.The bill would establish an Office of Election Crimes and Security within the Department of State with a staff of 15 to conduct preliminary investigations of election fraud. In addition, the measure calls for DeSantis to appoint up to 10 law enforcement officers to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to probe election crimes.The combined effort would have a budget of about $3.7 million, said state Rep. Daniel Perez, the Republican lawmaker guiding the bill through the House. DeSantis, who is up for reelection this year and is weighing a 2024 presidential bid, had initially proposed a 52-member force with a $5.7 million budget.Florida would become one of the first states to have a unit focused on election fraud.Read MoreElection fraud is exceedingly rare, and Democrats and Republicans in the state previously described the 2020 election as smoothly run. DeSantis last year said Florida passed its automatic post-election audits with \"flying colors.\"Perez said the new election crimes investigations unit would serve as an \"extra resource\" for local election supervisors to ensure \"there are absolutely no cases falling through the cracks.\"\"The more resources we have to attack the bad people, the bad actors who are committing fraud, the better for the state of Florida,\" Perez said during floor debate Tuesday night. \"The more the merrier.\"DeSantis strategizes for his future while Trump obsesses over his election lossThe legislation that passed the Florida House on Wednesday marks the second elections overhaul in two years to tighten voting laws in the state -- as supporters for former President Donald Trump clamor for further reviews of the 2020 election.Trump won the state by a comfortable margin, but he has spread baseless claims that election fraud contributed to his loss in other battleground states.The bill passed Wednesday would make it a felony to collect and submit more than two vote-by-mail ballots on behalf of other voters. It\\'s currently a misdemeanor to do so. It also increases the fine from $1,000 to $50,000 on organizations that violate election registration laws.Critics said it was overreach.\"We\\'re going to convict people of a felony because they helped three instead of two elderly neighbors?\" Democratic state Rep. Joseph Geller said, as he argued against the bill on Wednesday evening.The new elections security force and increased penalties could \"deter people from participation in the democratic process,\" said Daniel Griffith, policy director at Secure Democracy USA, a nonprofit organization that works to boost access to the ballot.Why Ron DeSantis wants to form an election security police forceGriffith said there appear to be few guardrails on the activity of the new elections investigations unit. \"We don\\'t know exactly what they are investigating: Are they investigating election officials? Are they investigating voters?\"Democrats in the Florida House raised concerns during this week\\'s debate that increased penalties could ensnare voter registration groups for making mistakes, such as misplacing a voter\\'s registration card, and chill their activity in the state.Responded Perez: \"If the third-party voter organization doesn\\'t commit fraud, they\\'re never going to have to be concerned about paying fines or fees.\"Cecile Scoon, the president of the Leagure of Women Voters of Florida, called the new $50,000 fine a \"direct threat\" to her organization. \"When you couple the increased fines with the new election investigators, it doesn\\'t give you a warm or cozy feeling,\" she told CNN.The bill also mandates that election supervisors conduct maintenance of voter lists more frequently and expands a ban on private funding of election administration to include \"the cost of any litigation.\"  (CNN)Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday called on Congress to pass federal voting rights legislation before walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 57th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, a key moment in the civil rights moment. \"A record number of people cast their ballots in the 2020 elections. It was a triumph of democracy in many ways. But not everyone saw it that way. Some saw it as a threat,\" Harris said, lamenting the raft of what she called \"un-American\" laws enacted in GOP-led states across the country that make it more difficult to vote. The vice president said she and President Joe Biden \"have put the full power of the executive branch behind our shared effort\" while criticizing Republican lawmakers for voting to block passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. \"If we all continue to work together, to march together, to fight together, we will secure the freedom to vote,\" Harris said. Harris advocated for filibuster reform in her remarks after Senate Democrats failed earlier this year to change filibuster rules to get around GOP opposition to advancing voting rights legislation.Read MoreShe called on those gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge \"to continue to push the Senate to not allow an arcane rule to deny us the sacred right.\"Bloody Sunday commemorates when, in 1965, 600 people began a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, demanding an end to discrimination in voter registration. At the Edmund Pettus Bridge, state and local lawmen attacked the marchers with billy clubs and tear gas, driving them back to Selma. Seventeen people were hospitalized and dozens more were injured by police.Harris said Sunday that those who marched across the bridge in 1965 did so not only to ensure the right to vote, but \"to ensure all the people of our nation, no matter where they start, have the opportunity to succeed.\" The vice president also met with civil rights leaders while in Alabama, according to the White House. She was joined by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, and Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Donald Remy. At the top of her remarks, Harris made note of Russia\\'s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"a reminder that freedom and democracy can never be taken for granted, by any of us.\"The first Black and first South Asian woman to hold the vice presidency, Harris has attended previous anniversary events in Selma. During virtual remarks at a commemoration service last year, she recalled joining the late Rep. John Lewis -- a civil rights icon who helped lead the 1965 march -- during the annual walk across the bridge three years earlier. \"I was with him on what would be his final walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. And I will hold that memory forever in my heart,\" Harris said at the time. Biden signed an executive order aimed at expanding voting access on last year\\'s Bloody Sunday anniversary.During his State of the Union speech last Tuesday, the President reiterated his call for Congress to pass and send several key pieces of voting rights legislation to his desk to be signed into law, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The bill is aimed at fighting voter suppression and updating portions of the Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law in the summer of 1965, months after Bloody Sunday. However, despite the White House\\'s efforts, Senate Democrats\\' failure to change the chamber\\'s filibuster rules essentially dashed their hopes of passing any federal legislative interventions on voting rights before the 2022 midterm elections.This story has been updated on Sunday with remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris. CNN\\'s Donald Judd contributed to this report.   (CNN)Kenya Goodson, a 46-year-old Black woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, has voted in every election since she was 19.  But last week\\'s Supreme Court decision to allow Alabama\\'s new congressional map -- which voting rights advocates say dilutes the power of Black voters -- to remain in place has left Goodson, who volunteers to register voters, discouraged about casting a ballot herself. \"I was really very hurt, you know, and angry really by the decision by our Supreme Court,\" said Goodson, an adjunct professor at the University of Montevallo. \"There are people that are making decisions, not because it\\'s the law, but they\\'re making decisions to uphold White supremacy by diluting my vote.\" \"It is discouraging because I don\\'t know what I could do as a citizen to change anything,\" she added.  Kenya Goodson registers voter and assists with the Census count at the Government Plaza in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Legal challenges are expected to continue in this case, and similar lawsuits have been filed in Texas and Georgia, which will bring the issue of voting rights, racial gerrymandering and discriminatory election practices to the forefront ahead of the midterm elections. Read MoreThe Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments over the Alabama map, which could determine the fate of the landmark Voting Rights Act.Goodson said she is still going to vote, and will encourage others to do so, because \"our ancestors ... helped us to get this right,\" but community organizers worry there could be \"devastating implications\" that marginalize Black voters and could, in turn, impact turnout and faith in the democratic process.  LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said this ruling is \"really rubber-stamping voter disenfranchisement.\" \"But it\\'s not just about Alabama,\" Brown added. \"It has implications for voter protections around the country.\" What is redistricting?Felicia Scalzetti, a redistricting organizer for the Alabama Election Protection Network and the Ordinary People Society, told CNN, \"The problem with redistricting is that ... it changes who you can vote for.\"  \"You can encourage people to turn out all you want,\" Scalzetti said. \"But if the slate of people on the ballot do not actually represent your community because your community is cut six ways to Sunday, there\\'s no amount of turning out that\\'s going to fix that.\"  Redistricting is the process of reallocating congressional seats every 10 years based on population changes reflected in the US Census and then redrawing the boundaries of the congressional districts so each has an equal population.  In 35 states, the legislature has control over the redistricting process, which raises concerns about the incumbent party manipulating the process in its favor, also known as partisan gerrymandering. In this election cycle, 20 of the 35 states are controlled by Republicans, compared with 11 favoring Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Four states have divided governments.  \\'They know where Black voters live\\': Challengers say \\'race blind\\' redistricting maps are anything butSimilarly, redrawing in terms of race is known as racial gerrymandering. Since voters of color tend to favor Democrats, redistricting driven by party interests or fueled by racial motivation -- whether to curb voters of color or amplify their influence -- go hand in hand.  Alabama\\'s Republican-drawn map gives Black voters the majority in only one of seven districts despite them making up 27% of the population. Thus, the Alabama lawsuit argued that it had been drawn based on race, and used the \"cracking\" and \"packing\" tactics to specifically dilute the power of Black voters.  The map lumped areas with high concentrations of Black people together in one district where they could be the majority -- known as packing -- and split up other Black voters in the state so they remain a minority in all other districts -- known as cracking. It will remain in place for the state\\'s primaries in May. \\n\\n\"The thinking that we could just disenfranchise people at the state level is still here and it still operates a large part of the state\\'s attitude toward our voting structure,\" Dev Wakeley, policy analyst at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit public policy advocacy organization, told CNN.Wakeley and others say the map is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any practice that denies or curtails the right to vote based on race. The law included a provision that mandated states with a history of discriminatory practices, which included Alabama, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral practices, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.  In fact, a lower court unanimously ruled that the new congressional map violates the Voting Rights Act, and the three-judge panel -- which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump -- ordered the state to draw another district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it.  What the Supreme Court\\'s decision on Alabama\\'s maps could mean for the Voting Rights Act\"No one had any faith that the state of Alabama was going to have voters\\' best interests at heart,\" Wakeley said. \"We expected a little more of an attempt at a fig leaf by the Supreme Court.\"  But with a conservative majority and in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to stay in place while the case plays out, and experts say the highest court\\'s decision \"sends a very strong signal.\"  David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on redistricting, told CNN, \"It\\'ll be harder for states to follow what we thought was settled law when it comes to creating minority-majority districts or even influence districts.\"  \"It\\'s going to be more of an uphill climb now for anyone to win a voting rights challenge,\" he added. Similar battles nationwide \"The sort of anti-democratic ideas that have infested a lot of Alabama decision makers are much more widespread,\" Wakeley said.  \"While we might be the sort of sandbox where these terrible policies come into play,\" he added, \"we\\'re far from alone.\"  Other states have also been accused of intentionally suppressing the vote of communities of color in their redistricting plans.  A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting powerMark Gaber, who litigates redistricting cases for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNN, \"It just seems, you know, that wherever the folks in power want to retain their power, they\\'ll, you know, have no sort of shame about violating voting rights of minorities.\" The Campaign Legal Center is a non-profit legal advocacy organization that has filed lawsuits against multiple states for racial and partisan gerrymandering.  Texas faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the Biden administration in December, for its congressional map, which the Justice Department says does not reflect the state\\'s growth in minority population.  The state was awarded two additional congressional seats due to minority communities, who made up 95% of the state\\'s overall population growth, but the Justice Department said Texas had drawn the map in a way that the two new seats would be decided by  majority-White voting populations.  The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit against Georgia last month on behalf of multiple advocacy groups, saying the state\\'s new congressional map is \"its latest assault on the rights of Black voters and other voters of color to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and elect candidates of their choice.\"The lawsuit alleges that Georgia, similarly to Alabama, packed voters of color into one district and spread out remaining voters of color to ensure they are the voting minority in two other districts.  \"We\\'re in a very sort of unstable time in this landscape of voting rights law, and also just generally about elections in the country,\" Gaber said. \"And I think the last decade of experience in America proves that now more than ever we need protections for Black and Latino voters.\"   A version of this story appeared in the CITIZEN BY CNN newsletter.

Rusty Bowers, but the Arizona House speaker has quietly made a name for himself in the state as the stealth killer of his party\\'s most extreme election ideas.First up was a bill that would have ripped up most voting rules in this battleground state and handed the state legislature the power to reject election results it didn\\'t like.

Mark Finchem\\'s resolution this month on Arizona\\'s 2020 election results. Finchem, a Republican running for secretary of state this year with Trump\\'s endorsement, makes mostly debunked claims of fraud to call for the results to be set aside in three counties. It includes Maricopa, the state\\'s most populous county, targeted last year in a problem-plagued ballot review ordered by Republicans in the state Senate.Bowers\\' response to the proposal, per The Arizona Republic: \"Mr. Finchem\\'s obviously unconstitutional and profoundly unwise proposal will receive all of the consideration it deserves.\"Bowers, a professional painter and sculptor who represents a district east of Phoenix, has a contrarian history -- at least when it comes to some of his party\\'s most outlandish maneuvers in recent years.He has described Trump and the then-President\\'s lawyer Rudy Giuliani calling him after the 2020 election, asking Bowers to somehow inject the legislature into the certification process before the state sent its slate of 11 presidential electors to Congress.Bowers told CNN\\'s Dianne Gallagher that he voted and campaigned for Trump but rebuffed that. \"I said, \\'No, I won\\'t,\\'\" Bowers recounted in a CNN interview last year, adding, \"\\'3.5 million people voted here, I\\'m not gonna unilaterally do that.\\'\"Bowers is term-limited in the Arizona House, and last week announced plans to run for the state Senate.Arizona at ground zeroEven as headline-grabbing election bills falter in Arizona, Republican lawmakers still are weighing a raft of proposals that could alter voting practices in a battleground state that President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes.They include bills that would:Allow a third-party to scour the voter registration database for ineligible votersMake it a crime to misplace a ballotRestrict the use of ballot drop boxesMake it a felony for a public official to register someone to vote on the same day as election dayCreate a new election integrity unit to investigate voter fraudA database maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows that Arizona accounts for nearly 10% of all the election-related bills in states this year.Alex Gulotta, a voting rights activist who runs the Arizona branch of All Voting is Local, said he credits Bowers with \"holding the line\" to block some of the most blatantly undemocratic ideas floated in the state.But, he said, \"there are actually a lot of bad things\" moving through the legislature \"that people are being silent about.\"Dates to watchThe stakes are high in Arizona this year.Voters will fill an open gubernatorial seat, now held by term-limited Republican Gov.

(CNN)The Republican-led push to restrict voting continues this year as lawmakers around the country set their sights on changing election laws. Lawmakers in 12 states have already introduced or pre-filed 96 bills that would make changes to voting laws for the 2022 session, according to an analysis from the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\\'s law school. That represents a 39% increase in bills from the same time last year, a sign that legislators have not let up on their efforts ahead of the midterms. The bills are part of a concerted effort by Republicans nationwide, who continue to cling to false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election to clamp down on access to the ballot box. \"It demonstrates that the trend of this being sort of a hot button and top political issue in state legislatures is continuing. And also gives us reason to worry that the passage of these new restrictive laws may also continue,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, acting director of voting rights and elections at Brennan. Of the total bills this year, more than half aim to make changes to mail-in voting, an option that became popular amid the pandemic as election officials balanced health precautions with ballot access. The bills also deal with increasing or imposing voter ID requirements for in-person voting and registration. Virginia is leading the push this year, with 34 pre-filed or introduced bills as of mid-January. Last year it was one of a handful of states that moved to expand access to voting, including restoring voting rights to 69,000 former felons, under its then-Democratically controlled state legislature and then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat.Read MoreBut in November, Republicans took back the state House and the executive office, a move that has since led to dozens of voting-related bills being proposed. Additionally, 13 states have pre-filed and introduced 41 bills that undermine the electoral process, according to Brennan. This includes bills like one in Arizona that would have given the state legislature the power to reject election results. The extreme measure was effectively killed last week by Republican state House Speaker Rusty Bowers. And, Brennan says, 16 bills have been introduced in eight states that would impose new criminal or civil penalties on election officials for making unintended errors, a trend that some critics of the legislation argue is leading to officials leaving their positions. Morales-Doyle said it\\'s early in the year and more bills could still be introduced as legislative sessions progress, but that because of this year\\'s elections, the bills could have more of a partisan motivation. \"It could be that there\\'s a lot of political reasons why a legislature might want to introduce a restrictive bill and sponsor it. But that doesn\\'t mean that the bill is going to go anywhere,\" Morales-Doyle told CNN on Wednesday. \"There\\'s more this year than there were last year so we at least have reason to be concerned about what might happen next.\" Washington (CNN)House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn on Tuesday said voting in this year\\'s midterm elections will be \"chaotic\" in the wake of a raft of new election laws passed by GOP-controlled legislatures.\"It is going to be chaotic, no question about that. I\\'ve been on the phone earlier today as well as some virtual meetings with the clergy all over the country,\" the South Carolina Democrat said on CNN\\'s \"Don Lemon Tonight\" when asked about the potential impact of the new laws. \"We are organizing now to fight this kind of suppression. We know what they are doing in Texas is designed to be able to deny voters the right to vote. We know that.\" Clyburn\\'s comments underscore frustrations and confusion expressed in Texas over the state\\'s new restrictive election law as early voting in Texas\\' March 1 primary is underway. Texas is one of 19 states that passed a total of 33 laws in 2021 that make it harder to vote, according to a tally by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\\'s School of Law.The first test of new state voting laws is not going wellLargely Republican-controlled legislatures last year raced to establish new voting rules amid false claims by former President Donald Trump that widespread voter fraud contributed to his election loss in 2020. New restrictions contemplated in other states this year\\xa0could bring another wave of changes ahead of the midterm elections.Texas\\' early voting -- which kicked off Monday for US congressional seats, governor and six other statewide offices -- positioned the state as one of the first to test the new laws, and as CNN reported, it has already left election officials and voters grappling with its requirements.Read MoreThe Texas law imposes a raft of changes in a state that already had some of the strictest voting regulations in the country.Among its provisions, the law establishes ID requirements to vote absentee and makes it a crime for a public official to mail absentee ballot applications to voters who haven\\'t requested them. As a result, there have been higher-than-usual rejection rates for absentee ballot applications. And some counties have begun to report new problems, like hundreds of mailed ballots flagged for rejection over ID requirements.Clyburn told Lemon on Tuesday that \"anybody that\\'s throwing up roadblocks to the right to vote are trying to destroy this democracy.\"\"The Republican Party seems to be hellbent on establishing an autocracy in this country,\" he said. \"And I would hope that the people of goodwill would come together and do what is necessary to stop this in its track so that this country can continue its pursuit of a more perfect union.\"CNN\\'s Fredreka Schouten and Kelly Mena contributed to this report.  (CNN)The Supreme Court\\'s action late Monday in an Alabama redistricting case foreshadows a new threat to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and electoral opportunities for Blacks and other racial minorities nationwide. The justices announced they would revisit a key section of the landmark law in upcoming months and in a 5-4 vote reinstated an Alabama congressional map that a lower court found had diluted the voting power of Blacks in the state. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court\\'s conservative majority in 2013 eviscerated a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election rules.Supreme Court lets GOP-drawn Alabama congressional map that critics say dilutes power of Black voters stay in placeThe new controversy could lead to a further hollowing out of a separate provision -- known as Section 2 and barring practices that racially discriminate -- specifically in the context of redistricting maps. Combined, the court\\'s actions could mean the reach of the Voting Rights Act is dramatically limited by the 2024 presidential election. Read MoreThis latest voting rights controversy arises against a broader erosion in America of democratic norms and a polarized electorate. States have increasingly adopted new restrictions for the polls, and federal legislation to safeguard voting rights has stalled in Congress. The conservatives who control today\\'s court have consistently enhanced states\\' control over election practices, while diminishing opportunities for federal oversight and judicial safeguards. In a case from Arizona last year, the justices narrowed the reach of Section 2 as they upheld policies requiring ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be wholly discarded and criminalizing third-party collection of absentee ballots, such as at nursing homes. The three liberal justices dissented Monday and warned that if the Supreme Court fully accepts Alabama\\'s legal rationale for opposing a second majority-Black district in the state, it \"would rewrite decades of this Court\\'s precedent\" that has given racial minorities an equal opportunity to participate in elections. Alabama\\'s population is 27% Black, and the state legislature created a map that would provide Blacks the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the state\\'s seven congressional districts.  By allowing the state to use that map, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, the court \"does a disservice to Black Alabamians who under that precedent have had their electoral power diminished -- in violation of a law this Court once knew to buttress all of American democracy.\" The surprising liberal consensus emerging about Biden\\'s Supreme Court decisionThe court\\'s acceptance of the Alabama dispute means the justices will begin the 2022-23 session next October with two racially charged controversies on its agenda. The justices recently announced they would hear lawsuits against race-based affirmative action practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. RELATED: The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retiresToday\\'s Supreme Court majority is plainly exerting its right-wing muscle with three new appointees of former President Donald Trump. In the current 2021-22 session that will run through June, the court already has signaled a willingness to plow through precedent related to abortion rights, gun control and religious liberties. A test of the Clean Air Act will be heard later this month as well. Voting rights pattern under Roberts The scope of the historic Voting Rights Act has been a recurring agenda item for the high court under Roberts\\' leadership.   In earlier decades, the high court upheld the sweep of the law, passed by Congress in the wake of the \"Bloody Sunday\" violence in Alabama. On March 7, 1965, state troopers with clubs and bullwhips attacked civil rights demonstrators crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. In a significant departure from prior court rulings, the justices in 2013 ended the VRA Section 5 requirement that states and other localities with a history of race discrimination obtain federal approval for any electoral changes. Taking the lead for a 5-4 majority, Roberts wrote that the problems that so-called Section 5 was designed to correct no longer existed. The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retires \"Our country has changed,\" Roberts wrote. That 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder left intact Section 2, related to direct government discrimination, but the majority now appears poised to curtail its coverage in redistricting. Monday\\'s paired cases, Merrill v. Milligan and Merrill v. Caster, involved Section 2 challenges to a congressional map drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature. After Black voters and civil rights advocates challenged the seven-district congressional map as discriminatory, a US three-judge district court ruled that it diluted the votes of the Black votes under Section 2\\'s prohibition on practices that deny a person the right to vote on account of race. The three-judge court said a second majority-Black district was possible, based on traditional redistricting criteria tied to the size of a population and their geographical compactness. The judges concluded in their decision that, \"under the totality of the circumstances, including the factors that the Supreme Court has instructed us to consider, Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.\" New York completes congressional redistricting, likely netting Democrats several seatsAs the Supreme Court on Monday restored the original map with only one Black-majority district and agreed to hear the legal merits of the case next session, the majority declined to explain its rationale. Roberts separately dissented, saying he believed the lower court\\'s map, and a second-Black majority district, should have permitted for the 2022 election cycle while the justices resolved the larger questions and set standards for future elections. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a concurring statement saying he believed it was too close to the upcoming midterm congressional elections in Alabama to replace the legislature\\'s map. He warned of possible \"chaos and confusion\" leading up to the May primary and November general election. Also in the majority were Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Regarding the timing of the case, Kagan countered for the three liberal dissenters, \"Alabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians\\' voting rights just because the court\\'s order came down in the first month of an election year.\"  In his dissent, Roberts referred to the comprehensive lower court decision: \"In my view,\" he wrote, \"the District Court properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction.\" Based on the standards of a 1986 case, Roberts said, the Blacks and advocacy groups challenging the Alabama map demonstrated the need for the second Black-majority district. But Roberts also said that the 1986 precedent governing the dispute, Thornburg v. Gingles, and related rulings \"have engendered considerable disagreement and uncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim.\" As a result, Roberts endorsed the majority\\'s decision to hear the Alabama controversy. \"(S)ubsequent elections,\" the chief justice wrote, \"would be governed\" by the Court\\'s final decision in the dispute, likely to handed down in 2023. Alabama state lawyers have advocated for a greater use of race-neutral criteria in redistricting. Kagan and the other liberal dissenters said their arguments were \"premised on an entirely new view of what the law requires\" and would likely lead to fewer districts where minority voters are able to elect their preferred candidates. Takeaways from the $2.3 million Ruth Bader Ginsburg library auction\"The District Court here did everything right under the law existing today,\" she continued. \"Staying its decision forces Black Alabamians to suffer what under that law is clear vote dilution.\"  On the special US district court that ruled on January 24 in the case were US appellate Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by President Bill Clinton, and US District Court Judges Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, appointed by President Donald Trump. In concluding that Blacks merited a second majority-Black congressional district because of their population and location, the judges also took account of another element for a Section 2 violation, \"that voting in the challenged districts is intensely racially polarized.\" \"This,\" the judges added, \"is not genuinely in dispute.\"   (CNN)What a difference four years makes in politics. At this point in 2017, Democrats were about to pull off a stunning Senate win against a very flawed opponent in the deeply red state of Alabama. It was one of many indications that Democrats were on their way to a big 2018 victory.Today, everything is different. Pretty much every single indicator that pointed to a Democratic wave in the 2018 midterms now points to a Republican one in the 2022 midterms.Here are some of those key factors to compare:Generic Congressional BallotStart with the fact that Democrats were up by about nine points in polling for the race for Congress in early December 2017. As it turned out, this was the margin by which they\\'d win the national House vote in November 2018. Read MoreThe Republicans hold an average two-point advantage on the generic ballot in December 2021. There have only been two midterm cycles since 1938 when Republicans had any lead on this measure at this point. One of those was 2002, when Republicans defied midterm history to gain House seats in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and very high approval ratings for President George W. Bush. The other was 2010 when they were up by two points on the generic ballot at this moment in time and went on to net gain 63 seats. Indeed, there have been ten times since 1938 when the opposition party (i.e. not in control of the presidency) led on the generic ballot this far from a midterm. They would go on to win a majority of seats in the midterm all ten of those times. Presidential Approval A big reason Republicans were struggling in December 2017 was that then-President Donald Trump\\'s average approval rating was at a meager 37%. It was the worst for an elected president about 11 months into his first term.President Joe Biden is not much better with an approval rating of about 42%. His is the second worst approval rating for an elected president at this point in their first term.Neither president was anywhere close to where a president\\'s ratings have been 13 months from the midterms in cycles in which his party gained or lost less than five seats in the House. (Republicans need a net pick up of at least five seats to gain control of the House.)The president\\'s approval rating was between 60% and 84% at this point the three times (1962 cycle, 1998 cycle and 2002 cycle) in the polling era there was this minimal loss or gain for the president\\'s party in a midterm election. Special Elections and Virginia Along with the polling, the special elections similarly point to a very different political environment from 2017. In more than 70 special state legislative and federal special elections through this point in the Trump presidency, Democratic candidates were doing an average of about 10 points better at this time than the 2016 presidential margin in that district or state was.Right now in 2021, Republicans are doing about five points better on average than the 2020 presidential margin in an average of nearly 60 special state legislative and federal special elections during the Biden presidency. While we still have a ways to go until the midterms, we know that the shift from the presidential baseline in special elections has been predictive of the next election. This has been true in midterms since 1994, and a lack of a major change from the 2016 baseline during the special elections in the lead up to 2020 was a major red flag that Republicans weren\\'t as in much trouble as some of the polling indicated. Beyond the special elections, Democrats also did more than 3.5 points better than the 2016 presidential margin in the regularly scheduled 2017 Virginia elections. This was true both in the gubernatorial race and an average of 100 House of Delegate races. Last month, Republicans did over 12 points better than the 2020 presidential margin in the gubernatorial and an average of the 100 House of Delegate races. In doing so, they swept the top of the ticket (governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general) and gained control of the House of Delegates.House RetirementsThe results and polling are a big reason that politicians have or did run for the hills. More than a dozen Republican House members announced they were retiring from public office by early December 2017. Only five Democrats were. Today, 11 House Democrats are retiring from public office at the end of the Congress. Just four Republicans are (excluding Rep. Devin Nunes, who is resigning). Looking at all retirements (including those running for other elected offices, but excluding resignations), 19 Democrats are leaving the House compared to 11 Republicans at the end of the this Congress. In December 2017, it was 23 Republicans to 13 Democrats retiring at the end of that Congress. Retirements are not a perfect indicator of future midterm outcomes, but they\\'re a sign. Elected officials are looking at the same statistics we are. They aren\\'t likely to retire en masse, unless they sense they\\'re going to lose power. That\\'s why the party that has had more elected officials retiring from public office has lost seats in eight of the last 12 midterm cycles since 1974. The Bottom LineThe opposition party has picked up 5 or more seats in 34 of 38 midterms since 1870. Not a lot so far suggests that the 2022 midterms will be any different.   (CNN)House Democrats are retiring in numbers not seen in decades as a dire political outlook, new district lines and a negative environment at the US Capitol have combined into a toxic brew for lawmakers considering their political futures.On Tuesday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice became the 30th Democrat to announce plans to not seek re-election in 2022. By comparison, only 13 House Republicans are planning to call it quits or seek higher office.\"I entered public service 30 years ago and never left,\" said Rice of her decision. \"I have always believed that holding political office is neither a destiny nor a right. As elected officials, we must give all we have and then know when it is time to allow others to serve.\"The 30 House Democratic retirements are the most for the party since 1992, when a whopping 41(!) Democrats walked away from their seats. If one more House Democrat retires before the election, the 2022 cycle will tie the 1976 and 1978 election cycles as the second most retirements in modern history for the party, with 31. Democrats have already seen more retirements in this cycle than the last two elections combined. Amy Walter, the editor of the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign tip sheet, cites three main reasons for the Democratic exodus. First, she told me the national environment; \"it\\'s bad out there for Democrats,\" she said. Second, the weight of history; \"they all know that it\\'s hard for party in White House to pick up seats. They can only afford to lose 5. They can do math.\" And, finally the \"environment\" in the Capitol itself; \"Talk to any member or staffer and they\\'ll tell you morale is low. It\\'s a combination of January 6th, a lack of civility, plus a frustration with a fact that most legislation is leadership driven instead of member driven.\"Read More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s a direct result of the malaise on Capitol Hill,\" said former New York Rep. Steve Israel, who previously ran the party\\'s House campaign committee. \"Most Members decide to retire when they calculate that they might lose their next election. These days people are deciding to retire when they\\'re confident they will win.\"Regardless of the reasons, the reality is that this rate of Democratic retirements begins to feed on itself at some point. If you are a Democratic member on the fence about running again and see a number of your colleagues deciding to end their political careers, that has to impact your own thinking. The more retirements there are, the easier it is for any one member to walk away. And that sort of snowball effect is what we\\'ve seen in recent weeks, with Democratic retirements coming hot and heavy.The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022And we know from history that open seats -- those without an incumbent running -- are more likely to flip parties than seats where the incumbent is seeking re-election.There is a solid -- if not perfect -- correlation between high retirement levels and House seat losses. In 1992, for example, Republicans netted 10 House seats in the general election, according to Brookings\\' Vital Statistics on Congress. In 1978, the Republican gain was 15. In 1976, however, Democrats actually gained a seat despite the 31 retirements from within their ranks.Democrats\\' issues are compounded by the fact that Republicans have kept their own retirements very low. If no other House Republican walks away this year, the 13 calling it quits will be the party\\'s lowest total since 1988. Add it up and you see LOTS of Democratic vulnerability and very little Republican danger.According to the Cook Political Report\\'s rankings, there are 38 competitive Democratic-held seats compared to just 19 Republican-held seats. With the House Democratic majority so thin, that disparity in competitive seats is a very ominous omen for Democrats\\' chances this fall.The simple fact is this: Democrats see the writing on the wall. Many are opting to retire rather than either lose a reelection bid or become a member of the minority party in the House in January 2023. And that is causing a vicious cycle that further narrows Democrats\\' chances this November.  (CNN)Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee announced Tuesday that he will not run for reelection, becoming the latest House Democrat to head for the exits as the party faces an uphill battle to retain control of the chamber in the 2022 midterms.\"Today I am announcing that I will not run for re-election to Congress. After 32 years in office, I will be leaving Congress next year,\" Cooper tweeted.\"I cannot thank the people of Nashville enough. You backed me more than almost anyone in Tennessee history,\" he said.The Tennessee Democrat is a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition and serves on the House Committee on Armed Services as well as the committees on Oversight and Reform and Budget.Cooper represents the state\\'s Fifth Congressional District, which covers the city of Nashville as well as other counties and outlying areas.Read MoreCNN reported in July that Republicans were considering breaking up Cooper\\'s district, which could help them gain another crucial seat in the House.In an interview at the time, Cooper acknowledged that Republicans could effectively decide his political fate and warned that they may weaken Nashville\\'s influence in Washington.\"They couldn\\'t beat me fairly,\" Cooper told CNN. \"So, now they\\'re trying to beat me by gerrymandering.\"In a longer statement released on Tuesday, Cooper said, \"Despite my strength at the polls, I could not stop the General Assembly from dismembering Nashville. No one tried harder to keep our city whole. I explored every possible way, including lawsuits, to stop the gerrymandering and to win one of the three new congressional districts that now divide Nashville.\"But, he continued on to say, \"there\\'s no way, at least for me in this election cycle, but there may be a path for other worthy candidates.\"Cooper said that he decided to announce his decision \"promptly so that others have more time to campaign.\"  He also said that he plans to return individual contributions he has received \"for this race so that donors can redirect them as they choose.\" This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.CNN\\'s Alex Rogers contributed to this report.   (CNN)Long-serving Democratic Reps. Jim Langevin of Rhode Island and Jerry McNerney of California announced Tuesday that they will not be seeking reelection in November, joining the more than two dozen House Democrats planning to retire after this term of Congress.McNerney, who has served since 2007, announced that he will not run for another term in Congress, pointing to California\\'s newly-drawn 9th congressional district. \"Today I am announcing that I will not seek reelection in California\\'s newly created 9th Congressional District,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"I am honored that the citizens of California\\'s 9th Congressional District chose me as their representative in the past five elections, and that those in California\\'s previous 11th Congressional District gave me the privilege of representing them for three terms.\"Instead, Democratic Rep. Josh Harder of California announced Tuesday he would run for the seat. McNerney is one of many House Democrats to announce they won\\'t run for reelection following the once-a-decade redistricting process. California\\'s redistricting commission last month formally approved the state\\'s new congressional map, which still favors Democrats but could create an opportunity for Republicans in the newly created 9th District that encompasses Stockton and San Joaquin county. Rhode Island has yet to finalize its congressional map. Read MoreIn a column for The Providence Journal, Langevin, who has served more than two decades in Congress, said he did not \"come to this decision lightly, but it is time for me to chart a new course, which will allow me to stay closer to home and spend more time with my family and friends.\"Langevin, first elected to Congress in 2000, became the first quadriplegic to serve in the US House. In 2010, he became the first person in a wheelchair to preside over the House of Representatives on the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act.As a 16-year-old, Langevin was left paralyzed after a gun accidentally discharged and a bullet struck him, while he was working with the Warwick Police Department as part of the Boy Scout Explorer program, according to his congressional biography.Langevin has also authored and backed cybersecurity legislation. He currently serves as the chair of the House Armed Services\\' subcommittee on cyber and co-founded the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus in 2008. He also co-chairs the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, among other caucuses.McNerney is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. He was the main sponsor of the Consumer Safety Technology Act, which would require agencies explore the use of AI to help with consumer safety and study the potential use of blockchain technology.Langevin and McNerney are at least the 27th and 28th House Democrats to announce they won\\'t seek reelection, as their party fights to maintain their slim majority in Congress in the 2022 midterm elections.Several high-profile Democrats, including Reps. Peter DeFazio, Jackie Speier, and Bobby Rush, already announced their intentions to leave Congress and retire after this session.This story has been updated. CNN\\'s Morgan Rimmer and Melissa DePalo contributed to this report.  (CNN)GOP Rep. Trey Hollingsworth of Indiana announced on Wednesday he will not seek a fourth term in November, becoming the 12th House Republican to say he won\\'t run for reelection. \"I ran for Congress to return this government to the people from the career politicians who had broken it, and I will be damned if I become one in the process,\" Hollingsworth wrote in an op-ed in the Indianapolis Star.First elected in 2016, he had pledged to serve no more than four terms.\"I want to be the change I want to see in this world, so, as I contemplate how I can work for you in new and better ways in the future, I won\\'t run for reelection this year,\" Hollingsworth wrote. \"You deserve a Member of Congress totally and completely focused on the 9th District, and, though I have remained committed to that promise these three terms, now I will fight for you and us in different ways.\"Hollingsworth sponsored a constitutional amendment last year to limit members of the House to four terms and senators to two terms.Read MoreOverall, 38 House members have now announced they won\\'t be seeking another term in 2022, when many lawmakers will be running in altered congressional districts thanks to redistricting. But the members who have so far announced their retirements include more than twice as many Democrats as Republicans, including long-serving Democratic members and committee chairs. Those departures underscore what could be fears about a tough midterm election year and the prospects of severing in the minority if Republicans win the majority. Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado became the latest House Democrat to announce his retirement on Monday. Eleven of the those 38 members not seeking reelection -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- are running for Senate or governor.  (CNN)Democratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan announced on Tuesday that she will not seek reelection to the House this year after four terms representing Michigan\\'s 14th District, becoming the 25th House Democrat to announce they\\'re leaving at the end of this term. \"Today, after reflecting on my journey -- and oh, my goodness, what a journey -- and having conversations with my family, I am announcing that I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,\" Lawrence said in a video posted to Twitter. \"I\\'m incredibly grateful for the people of Michigan\\'s 14th Congressional District who have placed their trust and vote in me -- in me, just a little Black girl from the east side of Detroit, you made me your congresswoman.\"Her announcement adds to a growing list of Democrats who have recently said they won\\'t runn for reelection in November\\'s midterms. Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois told the Chicago Sun-Times in an interview published Monday that he won\\'t run for a 16th term. Democrats face strong headwinds for retaining their slim majority in both chambers of Congress, and Republicans see President Joe Biden\\'s sagging approval numbers as an opportunity for the midterms.\\'We have got a problem here\\': Low morale and redistricting hand Democrats a growing retirement issueMany lawmakers are also facing new congressional maps after the once-a-decade redistricting process. Lawrence is the 36th member from either party to announce they\\'ll be leaving the House at the end of the term. That includes 11 members -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- who are running for Senate or governor.Lawrence, first elected in 2014, referenced redistricting in her Tuesday remarks. \"As we have a new redistricting map, a new generation of leaders will step up. We need to make sure our elected officials, in Michigan and across this country, look like our communities,\" she said.\"It is not lost on me that I\\'m currently the only Black member of the Michigan congressional delegation -- in both the US House and Senate. So, whether it\\'s in the halls of Congress, city halls or local school boards, representation matters,\" she added.Read MoreLawrence, the co-chair of the Democratic Women\\'s Caucus, was the first Black person and the first woman to be elected mayor in the city of Southfield, Michigan, according to her congressional biography. The Michigan congresswoman promised to fight to \"pass laws to protect our voting rights, women\\'s rights and to protect our environment\" during the remainder of her tenure, and while she did not expound on her future plans, she said that \"service to my community, service to my country\" will continue to be her \"guiding light.\" Chris Cillizza and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.   (CNN)There is a growing sense of gloom among Democrats in the House. And every week or so, when another Democratic member of Congress announces they won\\'t run for reelection in 2022, the mood inside the caucus worsens.Morale in the House is already markedly low, but as Democrats look ahead to what could become a trying midterm election cycle, the overwhelming belief is that the wave of retirements has yet to crash.That was captured on Monday when two Democratic members announced they would not seek reelection in November.The Democratic retirement floodgates just burst openFirst was Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, who announced she would not seek reelection after three terms in the House. She stated that her time in office was both \"the honor of my life\" and \"incredibly challenging for my family and me,\" but her decision comes as the Republican-led legislature in Florida has taken interest in redrawing the district she represents, a move that would have made it harder for the Democrat to hold onto the Orlando-area seat.Then came California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, who said in a statement Monday night that \"after thirty years in the House of Representatives, the time has come for me to spend more time with my family.\"Read MoreAnd then on Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed New Jersey Democratic Rep. Albio Sires would also retire.So far, 23 members of the House Democratic Caucus have announced they will not seek reelection. While it is common for the party in control to see a series of high-profile retirements ahead of a difficult midterm cycle, the sentiment inside the caucus is that even more departures are likely. A combination of political winds tilting toward Republicans, redistricting boxing some members out of easier races and an overall low morale among House members could lead to even more retirements in the coming months.\"We have got a problem here,\" retiring Rep. Cheri Bustos said of the general morale inside the House. \"There are way too many people serving as members of Congress right now who I not only don\\'t look up to, I have zero respect for. And I\\'m saddened to have to say that.\"Bustos, who was first elected in 2012 and represents western Illinois, announced she was retiring earlier in the year and told CNN that she was looking for \"a new chapter in her life.\" But it\\'s clear that the current standing of Congress loomed over the decision. Bustos said that while she believes some Democrats aren\\'t \"team players\" -- she did not name names -- the bulk of her concerns are with Republicans, and the prospect of turning over power to the GOP in 2022 is disturbing for all Democrats in Congress.\"When you\\'ve only got a three- or four-vote majority and you see people who are in tough districts announcing that they\\'re not running for reelection, yeah, everybody worries about what\\'s ahead,\" said Bustos, the former chair of House Democrats\\' campaign arm.Republicans have also had some noteworthy retirements. Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, announced earlier this year that he would not run for reelection, and California Rep. Devin Nunes announced last week that he would be leaving the House to become CEO of the Trump Media & Technology Group.Pelosi will stay around to lead House Democrats through the next election -- and perhaps beyondBut retirements are a problem Democrats, as the party in power, particularly can\\'t afford. The party has a slim majority in the House and with polls showing Republicans are overall in a better position to win congressional races next year, any slight change -- like an unexpected retirement in a swing seat -- could prove costly.Democratic members are aware of the party\\'s current standing on the generic ballot, a survey question that asks respondents if they would be more likely to vote for Democrats or Republicans and often serves as a leading indicator of who will do better in the subsequent midterms. The fear is that members considering retirement may factor in those polls as they finalize their decision in the coming weeks.The bigger issue, according to Jesse Ferguson, a veteran Democratic operative who previously worked at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is that retirements \"absolutely effect the psyche of the caucus\" because members who are staying \"evaluate these retirements based on their frame of reference inside the caucus, not based on the political implications of this open seat in the midterms.\"\\'A 2010 kind of problem\\'Retirements pose a problem for the party in power because time and money are finite resources, and retirements in competitive seats often require the party to expend both in a race they had not anticipated. First, the party must help recruit a candidate in the district, hoping to do whatever they can to make up for the name recognition that the retiring incumbent had. Second, the party\\'s campaign committees will have to spend money for that candidate -- a figure that is almost always significantly more than they would have spent on an incumbent.And Democratic retirements are stacking up.Earlier this month, Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon announced he would not seek reelection, leaving behind his powerful chairmanship of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.Earlier this year, Texas Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson announced she would not seek reelection, departing her role as chair of the Space, Science and Technology Committee. And Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, chair of the Budget Committee, also said he won\\'t see reelection in 2022.\\'A 50-50 Senate sucks\\': Dejected Democrats fret over agenda failure amid grim 2022 outlook But the problem extends far beyond powerful committee chairs and includes some districts that will be difficult for Democrats to hold in a tough year.Wisconsin Rep. Ron Kind, one of few Democrats who represents a district that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020, announced earlier this year he wouldn\\'t run again, opening a seat in an area Republicans are confident they could win. Arizona Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick was the first congressional Democrat to announce she would not seek reelection in March, vacating the Arizona\\'s 2nd Congressional District, which was represented by a Republican before she won in 2018. And New York Rep. Tom Suozzi recently announced he would run for governor and not seek reelection in his Long Island district, which could be competitive if Democrats face a particularly difficult cycle.Each retirement has been cheered by Republicans.\"Every Democratic retirement demoralizes their party further and forces Democrats to spend precious resources defending competitive seats,\" said Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"No one wants to run as a House Democrat this cycle.\"So far, Democratic leaders -- at least publicly -- are rejecting the idea that Democrats have a retirement problem.\"It\\'s pretty standard stuff,\" Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told CNN\\'s Manu Raju. \"Anybody who serves in this Congress knows that these are personal decisions. No, I\\'m not that worried about it. I think the Republicans are still going to have to have at least one good idea for America. They can\\'t do it with tricks and stacking the deck.\"Democrats walk on eggshells around Breyer as GOP plans another blockade for any Biden Supreme Court pickBut there is a sense inside the caucus that things have not been as rosy as Maloney and others would like people to believe.Rep. Filemón Vela, a Texas Democrat who announced earlier in the year that he would not seek reelection, said he is confident the party will do fine in the midterms \"if we\\'ve got control of inflation and Covid by the summer of next year.\"\"I\\'m not going to say we keep the majority because it is tight both ways,\" he said. \"But if next November comes around and we\\'re still in the middle of the Covid crisis and inflation is through the roof then, yeah, we\\'ve got a big problem.\"After a pause, Vela -- who said he was retiring because he \"wanted to do something else\" -- added that if those issue continue to pester Democrats, \"you\\'ve got a 2010 kind of problem,\" referencing the midterm election when Democrats lost 63 seats.\"It\\'s a valid concern,\" Vela said of worries about retirements. \"If we\\'d been in the middle of midterms last month, I think even seats like mine could have gotten lost. But I don\\'t think that is going to happen next year.\"\\'We haven\\'t hit Christmas yet\\'One of the reasons for gloom inside the Democratic caucus is that many of the members have experienced this trend before. In 2010, two years after President Barack Obama was elected, both parties had to deal with retirements -- 17 for Democrats, compared to 20 for Republicans. But voters still dealt a stinging blow to Democrats and vaulted Republican into power with a 63-seat shift.\"In 2010, it was far worse than anything since because several of those retirements came from overwhelmingly Republican districts that Democrats really couldn\\'t compete for once the incumbents had retired,\" said Ferguson. Ferguson added that one reason these retirements -- along with some of this year\\'s -- are particularly powerful is because they came from districts that became remarkably difficult for Democrats to defend.\"Not all retirements are equal, and retirements from seats you are unlikely to hold are the worse retirements,\" said Ferguson, who said a silver lining for the party is that only a few of the retirements this year have come in highly competitive districts.Retirements hit Republicans hard in 2018, with the party having to deal with a substantial 37 departures. Republicans at the time worried the figure presaged numerous defeats just two years after Trump took office. And they were right. Democrats would take back the House in 2018, dealing a blow to Trump and Republican control of Washington. \"The biggest problem is the surprise and the uncertainty. You know the competitive seats, two years before Election Day -- or at least most of them,\" said Matt Gorman, the top communications operative at the National Republican Congressional Committee during the 2018 midterms. \"When these pop up, often times, they are putting you in a worse spot than you were before. And it sucks up time and finding candidates to run and money.\"Gorman, like other political watchers, thinks Democrats\\' retirement problem is about to grow. \"We haven\\'t hit Christmas yet,\" he said, describing how destabilizing it was when GOP Rep. Darrell Issa -- who is now back in Congress -- announced he would not seek reelection in early January of 2018. \"That\\'s the time. You do it right after the holidays after you take about it with your family.\"This story has been updated with additional developments.   (CNN)Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy announced Monday that she will not seek a fourth term in Congress, the latest in a rapid series of retirements within the Democratic ranks that suggest momentum is moving heavily against the party as it seeks to hold on to its razor-thin majority next November.Murphy\\'s decision came less than 24 hours after New Jersey Rep. Albio Sires said he would be retiring at the end of this Congress. And, just before the Sires\\' news, California Rep. Alan Lowenthal said he, too, would be stepping aside.\\xa0All together, there are now 22 Democrats retiring or running for other offices this election cycle as opposed to just 11 Republicans doing the same.Two years ago, just nine Democrats had announced their retirement plans at this point of the election while 24 Republicans had done the same, according to CNN\\'s political unit.While there will always be some amount of attrition in a chamber as large as the House, the \"who\" is leaving should worry Democrats.Read MoreTake Murphy.

Without Murphy in the race, Republican map-makers will likely work to make the seat considerably more friendly to their side.Losing a member like Murphy -- a prodigious fundraiser and a talented campaigner -- is always a blow but more so in an election like this one where Democrats are clinging to their majority.\\xa0Ditto retirements of powerful chairs like John Yarmuth (Budget Committee) and Eddie Bernice Johnson (Science, Space and Technology Committee).When these sorts of members walk away -- either from powerful posts or promising careers -- it send a very clear signal to every single member of the Democratic caucus: Things are bad, I don\\'t see them getting better and now\\'s the time to head for the hills.And that message, of course, has a snowball effect as other members wondering about whether to run again see that their colleagues have concluded now is the time to go and jump ship themselves.The Point: House Democratic leaders have worked desperately to avoid a rush to the exits from within their ranks. It appears they have failed.  (CNN)On Monday, Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy announced that he would leave Congress when his eighth term expires at the end of 2022.On Tuesday, California Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier said she would retire next year after almost 15 years in Congress.Neither seat should be a problem for Democrats to hold. Vermont went for President Joe Biden by 35 points in 2020 -- his largest margin anywhere in the country. And Speier\\'s Bay Area 14th District gave Biden a whopping 89% of the vote last November.The bigger issue for Democrats then is not keeping those seats on their side. It\\'s that a steady drumbeat of retirements from within their ranks -- especially in the holiday period leading up to Thanksgiving and then Christmas -- is not at all what they want as they try to hold onto their slim majorities in the House and Senate.\\xa0Congress is like high school. Everyone is looking around to see what everyone else is doing -- and then adjusting their behavior accordingly.Read MoreThat doesn\\'t mean that a Democratic member who has never considered retirement will see the likes of Leahy leaving and think now is the time to go.But, for members who are undecided about whether or not to go for another term, retirements from within the Democratic ranks can impact their thinking.

As The Washington Post\\'s Paul Kane noted last month:\"The holiday season, from Thanksgiving through Christmas and into the new year, serves traditionally as a gut-check moment for lawmakers.\"From 2011 through 2020, the final two months of the off year and January of the election year have prompted the most retirement announcements for members of the House, according to data compiled by Ballotpedia.\"Which is why Democrats have to hope that tomorrow -- or the rest of this week -- doesn\\'t bring any more retirement announcements.The Point: Politics is a copycat business -- right down to the decision of when to retire. Democratic leaders need to make staying in Congress look as good as possible these next few weeks.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story wrongly described Rep. Jackie Speier\\'s congressional seat in one instance. Speier is a member of the House of Representatives. Laredo, Texas (CNN)Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros will advance to a May runoff after a neck-and-neck primary race that saw both finish below the 50% threshold necessary to secure the nomination outright, CNN projected Wednesday. Cuellar is the most conservative Democrat in the US House -- the only member of his caucus to oppose abortion rights, casting votes that have infuriated many in his party. Cisneros, an immigration lawyer, nearly ousted Cuellar in a 2020 primary. Weeks ahead of their rematch, Cuellar\\'s house was searched by the FBI, which Cisneros used in television ads to cast Cuellar as corrupt. The congressman has denied any wrongdoing. Ken Paxton and George P. Bush will advance to May runoff in Texas attorney general primary, CNN projects While Cisneros campaigned aggressively, Cuellar largely dropped off the trail, relying on TV ads and direct mail pieces that emphasized his experience and Laredo roots. A third candidate, Tannya Benavides, an organizer in South Texas who sought to position herself outside the progressive-versus-conservative frame, won nearly 5% of the vote -- enough to hold both Cuellar and Cisneros below the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff.While Cuellar and Cisneros are both from Laredo, the race split along geographic lines: Counties closer to San Antonio overwhelmingly supported the more progressive Cisneros, while Cuellar was dominant along the border.Read MoreHis strong performance in the Rio Grande Valley offered a window into Democrats\\' struggle with Latino voters, many of them more culturally conservative than the Democratic Party overall. Though Democrats have long led Republicans with those voters, President Joe Biden\\'s poor performance in portions of South Texas and South Florida in 2020 compared to Democrats in previous elections was enough to alarm the party.Cisneros was widely supported by progressive organizations and leading figures on the left, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Cuellar, though, is a political institution in South Texas. He served in the state House starting in 1987, then, briefly, as Texas secretary of state in 2001. In 2004, after he narrowly defeated a sitting Democratic lawmaker in the primary, he won his seat in Congress.Mail-in voting woes cast a shadow over Texas primaryHis performance in Webb County, the vote-rich home of Laredo, underscored how difficult he will be to oust in May despite the cloud of the FBI investigation and his decision to mostly avoid in-person campaign events. \"We are ready to keep going,\" he said in the statement. \"I look forward to once again winning the majority of voters and come May 24th, be re-elected as the Democratic Nominee for Congress.\"Cisneros, at a campaign party Tuesday night in Laredo, vowed to win in May. \"Today, we proved just how powerful our movement is and are ready to keep fighting for the future we deserve,\" she said in a Tuesday night statement. \"Together, we will take control back from Big Oil, private prisons, and Wall Street, and put it back where it belongs: with the people.\"This story has been updated with additional background.   (CNN)Republican Rep. Van Taylor of Texas suspended his reelection campaign Wednesday after admitting to an extra-marital affair, which he called the \"greatest failure\" of his life.His decision to drop his bid for another term in Congress comes one day after Taylor was forced into a runoff for the GOP nomination, having failed to garner more than 50% of the vote in the primary.\"About a year ago, I made a horrible mistake that has caused deep hurt and pain among those I love most in this world. I had an affair, it was wrong, and it was the greatest failure of my life,\" Taylor said in an email to supporters.\"I want to apologize for the pain I have caused with my indiscretion, most of all to my wife Anne and our three daughters.\"Allegations of Taylor\\'s infidelity surfaced in right-wing media days before Tuesday\\'s primary. On Tuesday evening, he was forced into a May runoff with Keith Self, a former Collin County judge.Read MoreSince 2019, Taylor has represented Texas\\'s 3rd District, which includes the suburbs of Dallas.\"I have let down so many other family members, friends, colleagues, supporters, and the people of the 3rd Congressional District whom I have had the great honor and privilege to represent. I am truly sorry, and I hope in time I can earn their forgiveness,\" Taylor continued in the statement.\"I have talked with Keith Self to let him know of my decision, and I wish him the best as he seeks to become the next congressman for this district.\"Taylor has until March 16 to file a request with Texas GOP Chairman Matt Rinaldi to withdraw his name from the runoff. Once that happens the second-place candidate -- whom CNN has projected will be Self -- will become the nominee and the primary runoff election for the office will not be held.  Self issued a statement acknowledging Taylor\\'s decision and saying he respected it.\"We debate competing ideas and we learn about our leaders\\' ideas and their character,\" Self said. \"We also hold them accountable. Conservatives who believe family values are the backbone of our nation are held to a high standard.\"This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.CNN\\'s Ethan Cohen contributed to this report. Laredo, Texas (CNN)Two of the biggest names in Texas politics could be headed to overtime in their efforts to fend off primary challengers.Texas kicked off the nation\\'s 2022 midterm election calendar Tuesday, holding the nation\\'s first primaries. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott easily defeated two vocal but poor-performing rivals and is now set for a marquee battle with Democrat Beto O\\'Rourke, the former congressman, in the fall, per CNN projections.But down-ballot, the primary fireworks aren\\'t over yet: Texas requires candidates to top 50% in order to advance directly to the general election. Otherwise, the top two primary finishers square off in a head-to-head runoff in May. CNN projected that embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton will face a runoff against state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the latest member of the Bush family\\'s political dynasty to emerge in Texas politics. Paxton\\'s failure to reach the 50% threshold was the only negative mark on Tuesday for former President Donald Trump, whose slate of endorsed candidates largely cruised in GOP primaries. And the Democratic primary in Texas\\' 28th District -- between Rep. Henry Cuellar, the party\\'s most conservative member of the US House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros -- was still undecided as of early Wednesday morning. Read MoreHere are six takeaways from the Texas primaries: Governor\\'s race is setTexas is set for a heavyweight match-up between Abbott, a prolific fundraiser with a $50 million war chest, and O\\'Rourke, the former Democratic congressman who has been his party\\'s only hope at winning statewide in recent years. Poll worker shortages and other glitches emerge as Texans kick off this year\\'s primary election seasonAbbott, who is seeking a third term, was always the favorite to win his party\\'s nomination despite far-right criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in its early days. But he spent $15 million to be sure of it, fending off former Florida congressman and Texas Republican Party chairman Allen West and former state Sen. Don Huffines. O\\'Rourke, meanwhile, is seeking office for the third time in five years. His near-miss in the 2018 race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz ignited Texas Democrats\\' hopes that the state, with a diverse and growing population and suburbs that have moved leftward, would soon become a battleground. Now, with a campaign focused on Abbott\\'s management of the grid failure that left much of Texas without power after a winter storm last year, he\\'ll seek to deliver on that promise in a year in which the national political environment could be much tougher for Democrats. Embattled AG faces runoff against BushTexas Attorney General Paxton was unable to reach the 50% support he needed to avoid a runoff, and will face a head-to-head match-up with a member of the state\\'s best-known political family. Paxton, a Republican with former President Donald Trump\\'s endorsement thanks to the attorney general\\'s lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, faced a crowded field of challengers. The efforts to oust him center on his legal troubles: Paxton has been under indictment since 2015 on securities fraud charges, and is being investigated by the FBI after former aides accused him of abusing the power of his office to help a political donor. As votes were being counted late Tuesday night, the second-leading vote-getter was Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He led former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and US Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Trump ally. Bush had aligned himself much more closely with Trump than other members of the Bush family. He told supporters Tuesday night that Paxton \"is going to divert attention away from his legal problems and personal challenges\" during their runoff. Cisneros, Cuellar could be headed for another roundThe rematch between Rep. Henry Cuellar, the most conservative Democrat in the US House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros, who nearly defeated him in 2020, was neck-and-neck Tuesday night. It could be headed for a runoff. Though Cuellar and Cisneros are both from Laredo, the race split along geographic lines: Counties closer to San Antonio overwhelmingly supported the more progressive Cisneros; along the border, Cuellar was dominant. Cuellar is a rare figure in Washington: a pro-gun rights, anti-abortion rights Democrat who outperforms the national party in an area where Democrats have rapidly lost ground to Republicans in recent presidential election cycles. The FBI searched Cuellar\\'s house weeks before the primary election. He largely dropped off the campaign trail, relying on television ads. That progressives could not defeat a hobbled Cuellar offered a window into the party\\'s left flank\\'s struggles to connect with Latinos in South Texas. A silver lining for progressivesProgressives did have one victory to celebrate Tuesday night: Greg Casar, a former Austin city councilman, was projected to win the 35th Congressional District primary outright, avoiding a runoff. Casar, who was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and campaigned with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is the favorite to win the seat in November. The 35th District, which stretches from Austin to San Antonio, is a new one drawn by Texas lawmakers during last year\\'s redistricting. It became a target for progressives after Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the incumbent who had represented parts of the new district, chose to run in a neighboring district. 15th District also heads to a runoffThe most competitive US House race in Texas this year could come in the 15th District, a South Texas district that stretches from towns east of San Antonio to the Rio Grande Valley. A roadmap to the 2022 midterm electionsRepublican Monica De La Cruz, who came within 3 percentage points of defeating Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020, will win the Republican nomination, CNN projected. Gonzalez, meanwhile, is running in the neighboring 34th District. But Democrats will have to wait until May 24 to determine her opponent. On Tuesday, the results of the Democratic primary remained to be seen. Ruben Ramirez, an attorney and Afghanistan war veteran, led the field, followed by a tight contest between Michelle Vallejo, a progressive favorite, and attorney John Villarreal Rigney for the second runoff spot.Trump\\'s \\'big night in Texas\\'Trump took a victory lap Tuesday night after every candidate he endorsed in Texas either won or advanced to a runoff. \"Big night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff,\" Trump said in a statement. Faulty ballots and frustration: Texans confront \\'nightmare\\' effects of new election law as early voting kicks offThat was partly by design: Trump only endorsed Republicans who were either already favored or were locks to win. His endorsement carried weight, but was not enough to help Paxton avoid a runoff. Trump did not involve himself in the 8th District race to replace retiring US Rep. Kevin Brady. But virtually all of his allies, and every other power player in the GOP, did.   (CNN)Texas Republicans will need a May runoff to decide their nominee for state attorney general after incumbent Ken Paxton fell short of clinching a majority in Tuesday\\'s primary, setting up a showdown with Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush in May, CNN projects.Paxton led the four-candidate field by a comfortable margin, despite feisty and well-funded challenges from Bush, former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman and Rep. Louie Gohmert.\"I guess what I\\'d say is, clearly, to the establishment: they got what they wanted,\" Paxton said in a speech to supporters late Tuesday. \"They got me in a runoff.\"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a two-term incumbent, will defeat a crowded field of GOP challengers to secure the gubernatorial nomination, while Beto O\\'Rourke, a former congressman and Senate and presidential candidate, will win the Democratic nomination, CNN projects.Votes are being counted in Texas in the first primaries of the 2022 midterms, with contests on both sides of the aisle poised to set the landscape for elections in November that could swing control of Congress to Republicans.Read MoreBut as the results came in, Texas shared the spotlight with President Joe Biden\\'s State of the Union address on Capitol Hill and the rapidly escalating crisis in Ukraine, where invading forces from Russia are moving in on major cities across the country.Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s troops were camped out on the Ukrainian border when early voting began in Texas on February 14, and while the conflict appears unlikely to influence Tuesday night\\'s elections, quick-moving events at home and abroad underscore the challenges facing candidates as the 2022 midterms begin in earnest.5 things to watch in the Texas primary electionThe banner contest on Tuesday revolved around Paxton, the two-term incumbent who filed a failed lawsuit seeking to effectively overturn the 2020 election and ran under a cloud of legal issues, with the possibility of more on the horizon. His GOP challengers, led by Bush and Guzman, argued he could endanger the GOP\\'s effort to yet again sweep statewide offices.Polling ahead of Election Day showed Paxton with a commanding lead but suggested he would fall short of the majority he needed to win the nomination outright.Bush, the latest in a political dynasty that, even with the Republican Party now in thrall to former President Donald Trump, maintains a considerable stature in Texas political circles and this campaign amounted a referendum on the future of that dynasty.    Like Bush, Guzman, who spent more than a decade on the state\\'s high court, is a relative moderate. The pair clashed in a recent debate, which saw Guzman question Bush\\'s qualifications and Bush denounce Guzman as a \"gutter politician.\" More troubling for Paxton, though, was been the candidacy of Gohmert, whose ideological and geographic base overlaps with Paxton\\'s. The Democratic primary for attorney general will also go to a runoff, CNN projected.Hanging over the primary were concerns -- at least among Democrats and voting rights advocates -- about the effect of the state\\'s restrictive new voting rules.Texas was the first of a number of Republican-led states to hold major elections after passing legislation, on the back of a political wave set off by Trump\\'s long campaign to sow doubt over his loss in 2020, that complicates mail-in voting and outlaws other efforts to make the ballot more accessible. Some larger Texas counties have reported spikes in ballot rejections because would-be voters did not meet beefed-up and, to many, confusing new identification requirements.   As polls closed, Harris County officials warned of delays in reporting results, due to \"damaged ballot sheets that need to be duplicated,\" according to a press release issued by state election officials late Tuesday. Later that night, Harris County election officials said that this was merely a \"preliminary discussion\" of a possible delay, and on Wednesday, they were confident they would meet the deadline to count votes while disputing earlier reports of \"damaged ballots.\"The primaries brought some poll worker shortages and other glitches, but Election Day itself was mostly calm -- with the scramble to fix the unusually high number of faulty mail-in ballots emerging as the biggest challenge from this first round of voting.The leading problem, said Isabel Longoria, who presides over elections in populous Harris County, was voters did not include identifying numbers on the return ballot envelopes under the flap. The tally of potential ballot rejections as of Monday would represent 30% of the mail-in-ballots submitted in the county. By contrast, fewer than 1% of mail-in ballots -- or about 8,300 ballots statewide -- were rejected in the 2020 general election, according to the US Election Assistance Commission.The decennial redistricting process has also added to primary night uncertainty -- and intrigue.With a new congressional map designed to further reduce the number of contested seats on the map, most of both parties\\' nominees can expect that their primaries will be more fiercely fought than the contests that await in November. The diminishing number of swing districts means there has been an even greater focus on campaigns that cast opposing flanks of the parties against one another.For Democrats, those contrasts have been on vivid display in the 28th Congressional District, where Rep. Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats remaining in the House, and progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros will advance to a runoff, CNN projected Wednesday. Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration attorney backed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, nearly ousted the congressman from the South Texas seat in 2020.But his district is modestly more Democratic this time around, and Cisneros had received a late boost in the race when it was revealed that Cuellar is under investigation by the FBI. Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing, and the specifics of the probe largely remain a mystery.In a cruel twist for the left, however, progressive candidate Tannya Benavides, who earned nearly 5% of the vote, may have siphoned enough support from Cisneros to prevent her from securing the 50% needed to avoid a runoff. Henry Cuellar is a political institution in South Texas. An FBI raid and a second challenge by progressive Jessica Cisneros could topple himRepublicans, including Trump, outperformed expectations with Latino voters in the 2020 elections and Cuellar has argued that his harder line on immigration issues, in a district that runs from the San Antonio suburbs down to the Rio Grande Valley and along the border to Laredo, is the only path for Democrats in the region. But victory for Cisneros in May -- and, should she win, the makeup of her coalition -- will provide new insight into what the shifting margins from two years ago portend for the fall elections. Even in this first round of voting, the divisions in the party were clear from early in the night. Cisneros\\' backbone of support came from the San Antonio suburbs, while Cuellar dominated in the border counties -- a breakdown that will give both flanks of the party reason to celebrate and cause to fret. The Republican primary for the 28th District was not decided Tuesday, with Cassy Garcia, a former staffer to Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, advancing to the runoff, CNN projects. The second spot for that May contest had not yet been called as of midday Wednesday.While Cuellar\\'s bid for survival captured the most attention, Republicans were also closely watching GOP turnout in other parts of South Texas after stepping up their recruitment of candidates to run in a region that has been dominated by Democrats for decades.Monica De La Cruz, who pulled off a surprising finish when she came within 3 points of dispatching Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in 2020, will win the GOP nomination for the newly redrawn 15th District, CNN projects, bolstered by the endorsement of both Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Democrats look to win back Latino voters after Trump\\'s inroads in South TexasThe crowded Democratic race to face off with De La Cruz will be decided in a runoff. Afghanistan veteran Ruben Ramirez, a lawyer and former high school teacher backed by Gonzalez, has secured his spot, CNN projects, but it remains unclear whether John Villarreal Rigney, an attorney and owner of a South Texas construction firm, or Michelle Vallejo, a progressive small business owner endorsed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, will be joining him.Gonzalez is now running in the neighboring 34th District, which became more favorable for Democrats after redistricting. He will win his primary outright to move on the general election where he will face Mayra Flores, who will best three other candidates in the GOP primary, CNN projects. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Cuellar-Cisneros race, another progressive backed by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, former Austin City Council Member Greg Casar, will advance to November, CNN projects, after earning a comfortable majority in the Democratic primary for the 35th District, a safe blue seat.On the Republican side, a perceived lack of fealty to Trump was among the factors that endangered incumbent Reps. Van Taylor and Dan Crenshaw. Taylor\\'s opponents in the 3rd District had attacked him over his vote to establish an independent commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The panel was rejected by Senate Republicans and effectively replaced by a select committee created by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But Taylor\\'s vote riled some Trump supporters, which fueled the opposition against him.CNN projected that Taylor would advance to a May runoff against former Collin County Judge Keith Self, but the congressman suspended his reelection bid on Wednesday after admitting to an extra-marital affair. Allegations of Taylor\\'s infidelity surfaced in right-wing media days before Tuesday\\'s primary. Crenshaw, who ran unopposed in the 2020 GOP primary, triumphed over multiple challengers in the 2nd District attacking him from the right -- a consequence, in part, of Texas Republicans\\' gerrymandering of the district to make it a safe red seat. Crenshaw is one of the most conservative members in the GOP conference, and was a signatory to Paxton\\'s 2020 election lawsuit, but he has occasionally sparred with the former President\\'s closest allies, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, most recently criticizing her for speaking at a White nationalist conference over the weekend. Greene and North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn were also opposing GOP leadership in the race to replace retiring GOP Rep. Kevin Brady in Texas\\' 8th District. Former Navy SEAL Morgan Luttrell is the national party\\'s choice, but far-right opponent Christian Collins had the backing of Greene, Cawthorn, Cruz, and Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff who was pardoned by Trump. The race was undecided as of Wednesday morning.This story has been updated with additional developments.   (CNN)On Tuesday night, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was forced into a May Republican primary runoff with George P. Bush, a victory for the Bush family in their long-running feud with former President Donald Trump.Paxton had been endorsed in the race by Trump, who called the embattled attorney general \"strong on Crime, Border Security, the Second Amendment, Election Integrity and, above all, our Constitution.\"Bush, on the other hand, is the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and a scion of the most famous family in establishment Republican politics. His father and Trump feuded regularly during the course of the 2016 campaign. Neither Jeb Bush nor his brother, former President George W. Bush, voted for Trump in 2016. (George W. Bush also revealed he didn\\'t vote for Trump in 2020.) Their late mother, Barbara Bush, said of Trump: \"He sort of makes faces and says insulting things.\"\"I guess what I\\'d say is, clearly, to the establishment: They got what they wanted,\" Paxton said in a speech to supporters late Tuesday. \"They got me in a runoff.\"With an estimated 96% of the vote in, Paxton stood at 43%, while George P. Bush was at 23%. The rest of the vote was split among two other primary challengers. Paxton and Bush will face off again on May 24.Read More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, while it\\'s fascinating to see the race -- and the results -- as a proxy war between the old face of the Republican Party (the Bushes) and its new face (Trump), the reality is slightly more nuanced.First, Paxton finds himself in significant legal jeopardy. In 2015, shortly after being elected as Texas attorney general, Paxton was indicted on charges of securities fraud. He pleaded not guilty and the trial continues to be delayed amid legal wrangling on both sides. Then, in October 2020, seven Paxton aides accused him of bribery and abuse of office -- charges that Paxton denied. (The FBI is reportedly looking into the allegations.)Bush, who currently serves as Texas Land Commissioner, made Paxton\\'s legal problems a key part of his case against the incumbent. In a speech on Tuesday night, he argued that nominating Paxton would cost Republicans the office in the fall. \"That\\'s what\\'s at stake in this race,\" he said, according to the Texas Tribune. \"That\\'s what this campaign is about. It\\'s not about one individual. It\\'s about preserving conservative values in our state.\"Second, Bush isn\\'t exactly a chip off the old block. While his father called Trump \"unhinged\" during the 2016 primary campaign, the younger Bush has been much more willing to bend the knee to the former President.In the days before he formally entered the attorney race in the summer of 2021, George P. Bush tweeted a picture of himself on a cell phone with this caption: \"Great to speak with President Trump to discuss the future of Texas and how we are keeping up the fight to put America first. I appreciate the words of encouragement and support.\"At the announcement itself, Bush supporters were handing out koozies that featured a drawing of him and Trump with a 2019 quote from the former President that read: \"This is the only Bush that likes me. This is the Bush that got it right. I like him.\" (George P. Bush endorsed Trump in the 2020 race, calling him \"the only thing standing between America and socialism.\")So, like I said, it\\'s not totally clear-cut that Paxton\\'s failure to avoid a runoff  is purely a referendum on the Bush family vs. Trump dynamic. But whether George P. Bush has said nice things about Trump in the past (and vice-versa), it is unmistakably true that he is the son of Jeb Bush and that Trump weighed in for Paxton early and strongly in the primary fight.Which means this is something of a proxy fight between the two sides. And it\\'s only going to get more intense over the next two and a half months. Alton, Texas (CNN)As shoppers browsed the market stalls at the Pulga Los Portales in the Rio Grande Valley, Armando Acosta and Albino Zuniga caught up over breakfast before opening their lotería stand, where customers often stop to play the traditional Mexican bingo-style game.  Over the past two years, these two friends have bonded through the twists and turns of the Covid-19 pandemic. But they diverge sharply over politics in this heavily Latino region of Texas, which had been viewed as a Democratic stronghold -- until 2020.  Former President Donald Trump dramatically improved his performance in many of the counties bordering Mexico compared to four years earlier -- gains that led the GOP this year to redouble efforts to recruit and invest in South Texas candidates, including many of Hispanic descent, up and down the ballot. The question now is whether the inroads the GOP made in 2020 will hold as Democrats try to cling to their House majority in November.  Albino Zuniga believes overly generous Covid-19 benefits have slowed the economic recovery. \"If you\\'re going to be something in life, you have to do it by yourself,\" he said during an interview at the Pulga Los Portales flea market in Alton, Texas.Tuesday\\'s primaries in the Lone Star State -- the first congressional primaries of 2022 -- are an early test for the two parties as they try to turn out voters like Acosta, 40, and Zuniga, 56, with control of Congress eventually hinging on narrowly divided districts like this one.  CNN spoke to several dozen Latino voters across the region, including here in the newly redrawn 15th District, an open seat that runs from the populous border areas near McAllen north to towns east of San Antonio. They raised an array of reasons why Trump resonated here more in 2020 than in 2016 -- namely his relentless focus on getting the economy reopened after Covid shutdowns -- as well as factors Democrats may need to address to win some of them back in 2022. Read MoreThough many of his family members are Democrats, Zuniga backed Trump in the last presidential election, saying the then-President\\'s message on immigration resonated for him as a legal immigrant from Mexico and the father of a Border Patrol agent. Trump\\'s message about getting people back to work mid-pandemic also connected with the ethos of hard work and self-reliance Zuniga says is inherent in Hispanic culture along the border. He was repelled, Zuniga said, by what he sees as the liberal drift of the Democratic Party. Those feelings only deepened as he watched President Joe Biden and the Democrat-controlled Congress hand out more Covid-related benefits to certain individuals that he believes have been too generous.  People play lotería for a chance to win prizes at the Pulga Los Portales.Though earlier Covid relief packages were passed under Trump with Republican support, that was a frequent criticism of Biden that CNN heard here from both Democratic and GOP voters voicing concerns about the economy and inflation.But Acosta hopes Latino voters will reward Democrats in November for economic relief passed by Congress under Biden, arguing that Republicans often look after the wealthy instead of those in need. He is supporting the congressional candidacy of progressive Democrat Michelle Vallejo, who co-owns Pulga Los Portales with her family and has championed a $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All.\"The Rio Grande Valley is divided because there\\'s a need for so many things like better salaries and infrastructure,\" Acosta said. \"Democrats are mostly focused on helping the people and if they help people, we should support them.\"  Michelle Vallejo, Democratic candidate for Texas\\' 15th Congressional District, says Democrats must \"show up\" and do a better job explaining to South Texans how their party\\'s policies will improve their lives. She co-owns the Pulga Los Portales flea market with her family. Democrats seek to re-engage South Texas Latinos   Stemming further losses among South Texas Latinos in 2022 and beyond first requires Democrats to diagnose what went wrong nearly two years ago -- an exercise that more than a dozen political strategists, organizers and party officials who work in this region answer with different theories.  The root cause, many Democrats say, was the party\\'s suspension of most in-person campaigning and door-knocking during the pandemic, which they say allowed Republicans to lead one-sided conversations with voters.  \"Democrats literally tried to phone it in, and you can\\'t do that,\" said Beto O\\'Rourke, the former Democratic congressman who\\'s running for governor, as he made a recent swing through Brownsville to knock on doors. Trump, he added, offered \"a false choice between health and jobs,\" while \"we left the field to them, literally, completely.\" Beto O\\'Rourke, Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and his wife Amy O\\'Rourke canvass a neighborhood in Brownsville, Texas, on Saturday, February 19. But Sylvia Bruni, the chair of the Webb County Democrats, has urged her party to also take a harder look at aspects of the national Democratic message in 2020 and how it played in South Texas. There\\'s a disconnect, for example, between strong support for abortion rights among Democrats nationally and voters in an area where Catholic views are deeply held. The disconnect sometimes extends to immigration and climate, too, amid concerns about border security in the Latino community here and anxiety about some Democrats\\' embrace of the Green New Deal in a region where jobs emanate from oil and gas.  Bruni believes that Democrats did not effectively counter Republican messaging in 2020, especially on abortion, guns and oil and gas. \"There was no message. ... It was really, \\'Hi, I\\'m Sylvia. I\\'m a Democrat. I hear you\\'re a Democrat. Are you going to vote for Joe Biden?\\' That was the message...and the others were eating our lunch.\"  She worries her party has not yet settled on strong, unifying themes for 2022 that will appeal to Latino voters and reverse GOP gains in the region. Webb County Democratic Party Chair Sylvia Bruni, seen here at the party\\'s headquarters in Laredo in November 2020, says Democrats must re-examine how their national message on abortion, guns and oil and gas can alienate some voters. \"If you do an inventory of everything this man, Biden, has been able to accomplish, it\\'s really pretty impressive. But he\\'s in a field of alligators, fielding off attacks and then working with a Congress that is absolutely hellbent on obstructing everything he does,\" she said. \"I know we have the substance from which to create the messages that fit the values of our community,\" she said. So far, \"I don\\'t think we\\'re getting it.\"  Latinos were still a key part of both Biden\\'s national coalition and his success in the Texas suburbs. Overall, Trump defeated Biden in the Lone Star State by less than 6 points in 2020 after defeating 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 9 points four years earlier. But Biden\\'s winning margins in many of the counties along the border were much narrower than Clinton\\'s in 2016. The operating assumption among Democrats was that Trump\\'s rhetoric about immigration -- dating back to his 2015 remarks that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists across the border -- would continue to alienate Latino voters. Instead, he notched symbolic wins in places like Zapata County, flipping it from blue to red four years after Clinton had won it by 33 points.  Monica De La Cruz, Republican candidate for Texas\\' 15th District,  argues that the GOP message on immigration resonates with Hispanic voters in South Texas. The margins in several Democratically held congressional districts in the Rio Grande Valley, including the current version of the 15th District, also tightened significantly in 2020. Republican Monica De La Cruz, who came within 3 points of toppling Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, is vying for the redrawn seat this year -- this time with more vocal support from Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. After changes to the district lines, Gonzalez is running in the neighboring 34th District, where the turf looks more favorable to Democrats. Current Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who held his seat with 55% of the vote last cycle, is retiring.Both De La Cruz and Mayra Flores, a high-profile Latina running for the GOP nomination in the 34th District, are bullish about the November general election in their districts, in part because they believe Democrats have fundamentally miscalculated the concerns that many Latino voters have about management of the southern border, the treatment of Border Patrol agents and the influx of undocumented immigrants -- a central focus of their campaigns.  \"The Hispanic values of faith, family, and freedom have always been the same,\" De La Cruz said during a recent interview at the Republican National Committee Hispanic Community Center in McAllen. Leaning into GOP talking points about the Democratic Party moving toward socialism, she alleged Democrats embrace critical race theory and disrespect law enforcement. \"None of those values are reflective of what Hispanics feel and what they stand for,\" she said.

The Hispanic community in South Texas said, \\'Hey, you do not own our vote. We are not loyal to you. And if you don\\'t get to work, we\\'re going to vote you out.\\'\"  Mayra Flores argues South Texas Democrats have taken Hispanic voters for granted. Gonzalez, the incumbent who narrowly defeated De La Cruz in 2020 and now could face Flores in November if they both win their primaries, called that fiction.   \"Trump didn\\'t do well because he was a Republican. It was his personality -- this bravado, lucha libre, if you will, that was attractive to many Latinos,\" he told CNN. Like O\\'Rourke, he argued that restrictive campaign protocols during the pandemic led to the erosion in the Democratic Party\\'s Latino support in South Texas. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who represents the 15th District and is a candidate for the redrawn 34th District, speaks alongside gubernatorial candidate Beto O\\'Rourke during a blockwalk kickoff event at Garfield Park in Brownsville, Texas.From the stage at a recent Tejano Democrats event, Gonzalez said some South Texans need to be reminded that Democrats brought them programs like Social Security and Medicare.\"These people that think they\\'re Republicans, many have just forgotten where they come from, and how we arrived and how we got here,\" he said.Democrat Ruben Ramirez, whose candidacy for the 15th District has been endorsed by Gonzalez, said Democrats must also connect with the economic anxiety that voters are feeling, which he tries to do by sharing his childhood experiences of living out of a car with his mom at one point and collecting extra cereal at school to bring home for his siblings. He often speaks to voters about how he thinks Democratic programs would \"help lift all boats.\"Democrat Ruben Ramirez, who\\'s running for the 15th District and is seen here outside the Lark Community Center early voting polling location in McAllen, says Democrats must do a better job explaining how their agenda would \"break the bonds of poverty\" for South Texas families. Examining the 2020 shifts toward the GOP and where the Democratic message fell short, Equis Research, a Democratic-leaning polling and research consortium, found that Trump\\'s approval rating in the final year before the 2020 election improved notably among both Latina voters and conservative Latino voters who displayed greater motivation to vote than in 2016. Equis Research co-founder Stephanie Valencia said one reason was that Latino voters in South Texas were more focused on their concerns about unemployment and the economy in 2020 than on Trump\\'s anti-immigrant rhetoric, which had dominated the conversation in 2016. The anxiety over Covid-19 shutdowns and the economy, Equis Research concluded, \"created a permission structure for formerly hesitant Latinos to embrace Trump\\'s candidacy.\"  Valencia noted that Latinos have experienced the pandemic in a very direct way as essential workers, caretakers and small business owners. Trump spoke to their concerns about \"keeping the lights on,\" she said, and now \"there\\'s a huge opportunity for the Biden administration to go out and sell its economic agenda, its job creation agenda to Latinos.\"  A mariachi band performs amid supporters of local Democratic candidates, including Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, outside the Brownsville Public Library polling location during early voting for the 2022 primary.Steep challenges for Democrats in a difficult economic climate But the hurdles facing Democrats are evident in conversations with many Latino voters here in South Texas.  Joel Martinez, a 42-year-old corrections officer who said he voted for Trump because of his business background, echoed concerns about government stimulus money.  \"The whole stimulus thing, it\\'s just supporting more -- I\\'m sorry to say it -- laziness,\" he said as he emerged from a polling place in Edinburg. \"You see it everywhere we go -- \\'Help wanted\\' -- and nobody wants to fill in the gaps.\"  There are different reasons behind the labor shortage and a fierce debate about whether extended unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and the child tax credit championed by the Biden administration have kept Americans from returning to work sooner. Inflation is also weighing heavily on Americans -- leading some voters here to blame Biden and Democrats, while others say that accusation is unfair. Republicans and Democrats stand side by side as they campaign for local candidates outside a polling location in Edinburg, Texas, during early voting.Nancy Morales, a 43-year-old Edinburg voter who used to be a Democrat but supported Trump, blamed high prices on pandemic-era stimulus passed under Biden and Democrats. She shuddered thinking about her recent bill for dinner at Chili\\'s and said she now reconsiders every trip out of the house because it costs so much to fill up her truck.\"Everything\\'s going up,\" she said. \"I bought a lemon for 48 cents! Each lemon! I was like \\'This is crazy!\\'\"  She hopes Republicans will have better ideas for getting prices under control and she is cheering on the new crop of GOP Latina candidates like De La Cruz, who she had just voted for in the 15th District primary. \"I said, \\'Woo! We need a change here. Let\\'s go ladies!\\'\"Lusia Cortina, who sells pre-arranged funeral plans at the Pulga Los Portales, said President Joe Biden has \"been doing okay\" but that life doesn\\'t feel normal yet. Lusia Cortina, a Democrat who sells pre-arranged funeral plans at her stall at the Pulga Los Portales, said much of the economic blame Biden is shouldering is unfair and credits him with helping things return closer to a pre-pandemic normal. But even she criticized Biden (and Trump) for presiding over \"too much spending\" that she thinks led to over-reliance on the government.  \"Now people don\\'t want to even look for jobs,\" she said, arguing that Biden and his party need to convey it\\'s up to Americans to \"get up on their own, instead of just handing them over the money.\"Both O\\'Rourke and Vallejo, the Democratic candidate who co-owns the Pulga Los Portales, stressed that connecting with voters\\' more local concerns over last year\\'s widespread power outages, for example, and the number of uninsured and under-insured people here will be critical in 2022.  Former Rep. Beto O\\'Rourke (center left), now running for governor, and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (right) speak with Robert Lopez (far left) and James Roussett while canvassing a neighborhood in Brownsville.\"People are burned out. People are exhausted. People are concerned about how they could even make their day-by-day functional,\" Vallejo said. \"Every single day we\\'re showing up. ... We\\'re letting people know that there is someone here in the fight.\"  (CNN)President Donald Trump may be on the verge on doing something that arguably no American leader has ever done:Make racism boring.When Trump released an ad Thursday demonizing Mexicans and blaming Democrats for allowing an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing police officers to stay in the United States, some called it Willie Horton 2.0.Horton was an African American man who was the subject of a notorious campaign ad released by an independent group of supporters of George H. W. Bush in the 1988 presidential campaign.  The scowling image of Horton, a convicted murderer and rapist, was shown all across America. The ad, which was shocking at the time, was credited with sinking the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.But this is a different America and a different President. Will it have the same impact?Read MoreMaybe not, and here\\'s why.Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms President George H. W. Bush was a patrician politician who was never known as a racial demagogue.  He was lampooned in Saturday Night Live sketches as a nerdy wimp. There was a shock element at the time that supporters of the Bush campaign would release such a blatantly racist ad.Is anyone shocked that Trump would release such an ad?\"This has been Donald Trump\\'s playbook for so long,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told CNN\\'s \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"Trump\\'s ad comes a week before the midterm elections. Trump and the conservative media machine have been on a tear recently, warning Americans about the migrants headed north. They\\'ve implied that these migrants might have rabies and smallpox and they may be infiltrated with Middle Easterners and gang members. Trump\\'s racist video is part of a broader GOP midterm strategy aimed at the conservative baseIf any other President said this, it could have ended their political career. But this is already a President who said African immigrants come from \"shithole\" countries, who once suggested that some Mexican immigrants were \"rapists,\" and who started his political career with a racist conspiracy theory that suggested that the nation\\'s first black President was actually born in Kenya and forged his birth certificate.Does this new ad from Trump really shock anyone?Trump has often been called the first \"Reality TV\" president. It\\'s long been noted that he knows how to say outrageous things and concoct colorful bad guys to keep his base and the media riled up.But commentators have recently noted that his rallies are being held at smaller venues and have not drawn the crowds they once did; and he\\'s losing support in the Midwestern states that propelled him into the Oval Office. After Trump recently said he might revoke birthright citizenship, some commentators said all Trump has left to offer is \"racial panic.\" Trump may now be on the verge of being that Reality TV star who is losing his ratings because he can no longer shock anymore.There will probably always be a segment of Americans who respond to raw racial appeals. But racism has more impact when it\\'s cloaked. Racism, of course, was never \"boring\" to many, such as the victims of lynchings. Yet there was a time when white supremacy was woven so deeply into the fabric of ordinary American life that it seemed almost mundane, just another part of ordinary life.That\\'s part of the reason why the Horton ad was so effective -- it was cloaked.  It was positioned as a he\\'s-not-tough-enough-on-crime attack against a candidate, when it was really saying he\\'s a wussy liberal who won\\'t protect your family against the big bad black man.Trump\\'s recent ad and his recent rhetoric take away that cloak.But more than anything, through the sheer volume of repetition, it can cause people to tune Trump out. And when they tune you out, that is perhaps the worst thing that can happen to a man like Trump.Racism works best when it\\'s cloaked. Make it too raw and repeat it too much and we may soon find out that what once worked in 1988 will no longer persuade most Americans. We\\'ll find out next week if this is true.  Maunabo, Puerto Rico (CNN)Lourdes Rodriguez heard the scream early on the morning of January 6, before the sun rose and before the frogs began their chorus. \"Lourdes! Lourdes!\"She instantly recognized the voice of her father, Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, 77, a former nurse who cared for the mentally ill, people he believed society had forgotten. She darted up the stairs.Her father\\'s health had long been troubled. He had diabetes, lung disease, sleep apnea and congestive heart failure. And in the months since Hurricane Maria battered this coastal town, Lourdes watched his condition worsen. The sleep apnea machine he needed to help him breathe was useless for months because their hilltop neighborhood in Maunabo was entirely without electric power. In December, a business had donated a generator to power the machine at night, but the family struggled to afford the gasoline needed to keep it running. Read MoreAs Lourdes reached the top of the stairs, she felt an uneasy stillness in the air. The sky was thick and black. No moon was visible. And the electric generator, a machine that sometimes rumbled like a car engine, had fallen eerily silent.She swung open the living room door to find her father clutching his chest. The machine was off. Her father appeared unable to breathe. Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, center, is shown with his family.Her mother, Julia \"Miriam\" Rodriguez, stayed with Natalio while Lourdes rushed to restart the generator, which had run out of gas, and repower the breathing machine. Her mother felt Natalio\\'s body go limp in her arms and then collapse to the floor, face down. Frantic, they called 911 and tried to comfort him. Waiting there on the floor, Julia Rodriguez told me, she felt a wind -- a physical gust -- leave her husband\\'s body and pass into her own. She said it was as if the decades they\\'d spent together -- the moves from Puerto Rico to the mainland and back; the hours they both worked as nurses; the three children they raised -- hovered in the room, a tangible, living thing, and then became part of her. Julia Rodriguez knew then that her husband might not survive. All these months later, it seemed the storm may have won.* * * * *It\\'s been nearly six months since Hurricane Maria. Its howling winds, which topped 150 mph, long have dissipated. The storm that battered Puerto Rico on September 20 before hooking northward into the Atlantic is a memory. Yet, in this US commonwealth, people are still dying in Maria\\'s wake. That\\'s especially true of those who lack basic services like electricity.  Rodriguez died on January 6. In addition to his death, CNN identified five people who died in 2018 from causes that friends, family, doctors or funeral home directors consider to be related to Hurricane Maria and its aftermath. It\\'s not possible to say with 100% certainty that a death this long after a storm was \"caused\" by Hurricane Maria, experts told me. But that\\'s beside the point. These deaths show dangerous conditions persist in Puerto Rico.I spent several days in Maunabo, Rodriguez\\'s town on the southeast coast, and other areas without power, to try to understand how communities are faring all these months later.Maunabo, Puerto Rico, is still off the grid almost six months after Maria, the mayor tells CNN.I had been to Puerto Rico several times since the storm, reporting for CNN on topics from uncounted deaths to water outages and an \"exodus\" to the US mainland. In December, I drove the entire path the eye of the storm took across the island. On that route, I met a woman whose clock was stopped at 3:27 -- the moment the hurricane swept through. Puerto Rico, it seemed, was an island frozen in time, doomed to relive that day again and again.  Would that still be the case after six months?Metrics on the response to Hurricane Maria told me that might be the case, at least for some residents. So, too, did academics and others who study how we respond to hurricanes. Puerto Rico, some of these experts said, appears to be stuck between the \"emergency\" and \"recovery\" phases of disaster response. Typically, in the United States, the emergency phase -- in which people lack necessities like food, water, shelter and power -- lasts for days or, at most, a few weeks, said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. Then comes recovery, when residents, government agencies and others start to rebuild. \"Here we are months after this storm and we are debating if we should still be sending these emergency -- really emergency, and life sustaining -- supports, or (should we) transition into this recovery process,\" Peek said. \"That is just truly breathtaking.\" It\\'s true that progress has been made. Tourists are coming back to San Juan, and parts of the city are humming. Casinos are open in ritzy Condado and the bomba dancers are back in Río Piedras. A month after Maria, roughly 1 million of the 3.3 million American citizens here remained without running water service. Now, nearly everyone has it. In late December, only about a third of temporary roof requests had been met by the US Army Corps of Engineers, leaving some people sleeping in homes where it rained inside at night. Months later, nearly all those requests for professionally installed tarps have been fulfilled. Formal shelters for hurricane victims are now empty, according to federal officials.Yet inequities remain, especially when it comes to electricity. As of March 7, more than 10% of electric customers in Puerto Rico were still without power, according to figures reported to the US Department of Energy by the local utility. Maybe that sounds small -- but it represents nearly 156,000 customers, and likely more than that number of people, since the average Puerto Rican household is about three individuals. Also consider that figure in the context of other recent storms. \\n\\nHurricane Harvey hit the Gulf Coast of Texas on August 25. The next day, an estimated 304,000 customers were without power -- yet all but about 2,600 had electricity restored in 19 days, according to data provided to CNN by the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Florida after Hurricane Irma? That storm left an estimated 6.2 million customers in Florida without electricity on September 11, according to the Florida Public Service Commission, which, like the commission in Texas, collects data from electric utilities. In a little more than two weeks, virtually all power was back. These comparisons are, of course, imprecise. No two storms are the same in terms of intensity, needs or geography. Puerto Rico is an island and, as federal officials have said repeatedly since the storm, you can\\'t just drive in supplies from another state. Communications systems were down and many roads were impassible in the first weeks after the storm. The island\\'s power grid also was in lousy shape, by many accounts, before Hurricane Maria. Comparing that grid to Florida\\'s, which is the gold standard for preparedness, is somewhat unfair, said Seth Guikema, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Michigan, who studies grids and disaster response. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, he said, some Florida utilities built concrete posts and took other measures to ensure power could be restored faster after storms.The US Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, which oversees disaster recovery, says it is doing everything possible to ensure basic services are restored to Puerto Rico.Michael Byrne, FEMA\\'s federal coordinating officer for Puerto Rico, told me in an interview that Puerto Rico\\'s unique logistical challenges fully explain the delays. No other US disaster has presented these unique and difficult circumstances, he said, which meant FEMA had to invent a strategy for how to respond to the crisis. The unique situation here also makes comparisons between the response to Maria and responses to other storms problematic, he said.If storm-related deaths are continuing, he said, his heart goes out to affected families. \"The initial reaction is the reaction anyone would have: I\\'m sorry to hear that. Truly. One of the things that you don\\'t stop being, no matter your job, is a human being.\" There are programs, he added, to help bring generators and financial assistance to storm victims, especially those who are in vital need of medical services. The US Army Corps and FEMA say logistical issues -- including Puerto Rico\\'s remote location -- explain power-restoration delays.In a statement emailed to CNN this week, the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is helping with power restoration, said back-to-back 2017 disasters, the remoteness of the island and the fact that some supplies had to be manufactured for installation in Puerto Rico, slowed down work on the electric system. \"Helicopters have been used to airlift poles, materials and people into remote locations to perform repair work,\" the Corps said.Yet these explanations matter little to many of those who have been living without electricity for nearly six months, and have gone without running water for much of that time. They know another truth: The longer the wait, the more a person is at risk. * * * * *The family legend goes like this: The first of Natalio Rodriguez\\'s ancestors to arrive in Maunabo was hidden in a barrel aboard a ship from Africa. He may have arrived as a free man, they said. This much is sure: Rodriguez roots travel deep into this fertile soil. The family has been here as long as anyone can remember. By the time Natalio Rodriguez was born in December 1940, the 11th of 12 children, much had changed in Puerto Rico -- and yet little had, as well. Rodriguez grew up helping his father, Juan Ines Rodriguez Monclova, work the verdant sugar cane fields behind their home on the side of a shark-tooth mountain. This was the work of his ancestors, too. The Spanish enslaved Africans and, before that, indigenous Taino people -- who gave Maunabo its name -- to work in that industry. Natalio Rodriguez and his neighbors had all those stories coursing through their veins. His original ancestor in Maunabo is said to have married a Spanish woman, which is how relatives explain the fact that some of their cousins and aunts have bright blue or green eyes, while Natalio\\'s and Lourdes\\' eyes and skin carry the deep hues of espresso and midnight. Lourdes Rodriguez, right, with her two children and mother, Julia \"Miriam\" Rodriguez.When Rodriguez was a boy, slavery had long been abolished, of course; and the Spanish had been kicked out of Puerto Rico by a new colonial power: the United States. The US, which occupied Puerto Rico in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, granted Puerto Ricans citizenship about two decades before Rodriguez\\'s birth. Still, his family members and neighbors couldn\\'t elect their own governor until 1948. Even today, Puerto Ricans, while subject to US laws and given US aid, can\\'t vote for president or elect full, voting members of Congress. Despite all that, young Rodriguez remained enchanted by American culture. He loved Western movies and books and grew up galloping the family\\'s horses down from the mountains and into the valley, which was home to the town square, not far from a lighthouse and the radiant turquoise coast. His childhood nickname was \"Hormiguero,\" Spanish for anthill, his longtime friend, Damian Lopez, 70, told me. I laughed and asked about the origin of that name. The kid was something of a living verb, Lopez said -- always moving, never still. That restlessness would take him places his father never saw. Some of Rodriguez\\'s older brothers enlisted in the US military (one lost part of his hand in the Korean War, according to Julia Rodriguez) and, as a teenager, Natalio Rodriguez tried to do the same. Unable to join the service because of a heart arrhythmia, according to his wife, he found other ways to follow in their footsteps. After one brother moved to New York -- bringing home exotic northeastern foods like cod, cherries and white grapes to a family that grew avocado, grapefruit and oranges -- Rodriguez decided, after high school, to move there, too. He would become a big man like his dad -- 5-foot-9 and 300 pounds -- and not averse to physical labor. But he began to resent helping in the sugar fields. Maunabo was, and is, desperately poor. (Fifty-six percent live below the poverty line, according to the US Census Bureau). Some of his relatives still plowed up their fields with bulls tied to oxcarts. The brother who moved away seemed so much happier, and so much richer. In the United States, Rodriguez thought, he\\'d have a better life, too.So, in his late teens, Rodriguez boarded a plane for New York. \"Right after getting out of the cab, he stepped on a pile of dog s---.\" Natalio loved to tell this story, his wife, Julia, said.\"He\\'d go, like, \\'Wow, so this is how you all live here, dodging piles of poop in the streets!?\\'\" Maunabo, located in southeast Puerto Rico, is home to 11,500 people. Julia Rodriguez grew up in Maunabo, too, just up the hill from Natalio and his family. The couple raised three children together, primarily on the US mainland. For him, the 50 states were a place of promise and of hope -- a place of purpose and duty.Still, strangely, that first New York impression -- the muck on the street -- stuck with him, too.He never felt fully settled, his wife told me. He yearned for home. In 2009, he and Julia finally resettled in Maunabo. * * * * *\"Look,\" says Luis Lafuente, Maunabo\\'s vice-mayor. He points at a perfectly circular hole extending from the roof of city hall.\"That\\'s where the clock used to be.\" It was busted by Hurricane Maria.Crabbing and fishing are popular in Maunabo. The town hosts an annual crab festival.Time hasn\\'t just stopped in this town, which is at the southeast corner of Puerto Rico, near where Maria delivered its first punches. After the storm, it\\'s almost irrelevant. On this day, March 9, Lafuente tells me exactly 0% of the area\\'s 11,500 residents have been reconnected to the electric grid -- the same as the day Hurricane Maria struck. Between 35% and 50% of residents do have electricity, he said, from three emergency generators installed on December 23 by the US government. But those generators are prone to failure, he said, and don\\'t reach mountain communities. (The Army Corps said the alleged \"failures\" result from generator switch-overs, not from problems with the equipment. The Puerto Rican power authority -- PREPA -- told CNN 37% of customers in Maunabo had power as of March 13, but did not specify the source of that electricity.)At dusk, those mountains turn to charcoal silhouettes. Few lights shine. Only the lucky and the wealthy can afford personal generators. We drive Lafuente\\'s Jeep Renegade around the town where he\\'s spent his life. Parts of it are unrecognizable to him. Playgrounds are twisted. A truck barn turned to scrap metal. Power lines are draped over posts like wet noodles. Some electric posts are so off-kilter, they look like they\\'re doing pushups. The hospital had to be relocated to another municipal building, which most recently had been home to emergency management workers and police. Those officers and workers, in turn, had to move into a public school that closed before the storm. The hospital still has a sign that says \"Emergencia 24 Horas,\" indicating the emergency room never closes. The reconfigured hospital, however, opens at 7 a.m. and closes at 11 p.m. Many of those who require emergency assistance earlier or later than that have to drive through an unlit mountain tunnel -- it feels like something out of \"The Walking Dead\" -- to seek medical help. Maunabo\\'s five schools reopened in late November. But students leave class at 12:30 p.m. because there\\'s no power. A school principal I met told me she drives to other towns to make photocopies so students can take tests. Teachers assign very little homework, she says, because the students are so overwhelmed already.We stop by the lighthouse, perhaps the most iconic site in Maunabo, to find that its searchlight and glass have been shattered by Maria. The Coast Guard hadn\\'t used it since the 1990s, anyway, according to Wanda Marín Rivera, board president of the town\\'s cultural center. But Lafuente and others had hoped tourism might revive the town, with the lighthouse as a destination, since sugar cane, plantains and crab fishing haven\\'t been providing stable work. (Maunabo became known as a hub for crab fishing. Crab images are stamped into the sidewalks and painted on walls; a crab statue sits in front of the baseball stadium, which was heavily damaged, and a smaller one perches on the mayor\\'s desk).Despite the state of things, Lafuente says Maunabo will improve. Tourists will come. Industry will pick back up. Already, he says, crabbers are setting traps by flashlight at night. \"The people of Maunabo are very motivated and anxious to grow and make the town even better than it was before,\" he tells me. \"We will rise again. We are rising.\"* * * * *At first, the mountain protected them. The day Maria hit, Natalio Rodriguez huddled in a small bathroom with his wife, his daughter Lourdes, her two children, and, nearby, Natalio\\'s elderly sister. \"We were crammed like tuna in a can,\" Lourdes Rodriguez recalled. Water poured under the door. Natalio told everyone to stay calm, Lourdes told me. Meanwhile, she said, the house \"shook like Jell-O.\" Still, they survived. Most of the house did, too. The hillside, which had raised so many of their ancestors and grown so many of their crops, sheltered them from the worst of it. Julia Rodriguez has been without electric power service since Maria hit on September 20.It was after Maria that the real danger began. The power was out. Water, too. Food was scarce. For several days, the winding, steep-pitched road to their mountain home was blocked, Lourdes said. It was a week before she was able to wait in hourslong lines for gasoline and get her car to a hill in a neighboring city, Caguas, where she could call their many relatives on the mainland to say they had outlasted the hurricane. Communications systems in Maunabo remained essentially inoperable for months, she told me. Island-wide, according to Puerto Rico government data, only 25% of cell towers were functional by October 20.It was in these isolated circumstances that Natalio Rodriguez\\'s medical conditions began to worsen. The labored breathing was especially troubling for his wife and daughter. The sleep apnea machine he used at night to get oxygen into his lungs wasn\\'t working without electricity. That meant he and his wife could not rest, much less sleep. He paced the house at night and walked the neighborhood by day. In desperation, the family made cardboard fans for him to use to try to move air around his face. No one thought it would help him breathe, really, but it was something. \"All of a sudden he became a quiet person. He was a talker. Pepito enjoyed long conversations,\" Julia Rodriguez said, using Natalio\\'s family nickname. \"He could spend hours and hours talking. But then (after the storm) he didn\\'t speak much.\" The family worried also about the insulin he used for diabetes. It required refrigeration. They had no working refrigerator without power. And ice was difficult to come by. What they really needed, of course, was electricity.On November 17, Maunabo plaza and city hall got power from a small generator -- purchased for $35,000 by the municipality, according to the mayor, Jorge Márquez. From their home in the mountains, Lourdes Rodriguez said, the family could see a faint glow. It looked like the town downhill was on another planet. About a month later, the family received a small power inverter, Lourdes Rodriguez said. It ran for only two or three hours before running out of fuel, she said.A bigger generator was donated later, but the family had trouble affording the gasoline needed to run it, she told me. The fuel alone cost them $60 per week while her father was alive, Lourdes Rodriguez said. Plus, there were filters, oil and repairs. When the machine was on, they said, Natalio calmed some. But they could not keep it going. * * * * *Some of them died during the storm. A mudslide in Utuado, Puerto Rico, killed two \"bedridden\" sisters. Another person drowned in Toa Baja. But the aftermath of Hurricane Maria appears to have been most deadly.Hurricane debris is piled up at a temporary dump in March in Maunabo.More than 1,000 \"excess deaths\" occurred after the storm, in September and October 2017, than during the same timeframe in 2016 and 2015, according to Alexis Santos, a professor at Penn State University who analyzed Puerto Rican government mortality statistics.That doesn\\'t tell you 1,000 people certainly died directly because of Hurricane Maria. But it does indicate an unusual number of people were dying -- and well into October.The only difference, Santos said, was the hurricane.In November, I put together a CNN team to survey the funeral homes in Puerto Rico. We were only able to reach about half, but those directors and other staff members told us they had seen at least 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane related, based primarily on their conversations with family members. We then documented the deaths of several uncounted people who died in the weeks after the hurricane, not only the day the storm hit. They included an older man in Cayey who died in a fire set by a lantern he wouldn\\'t have been using if he\\'d had electricity; a man in Canóvanas who committed suicide in the storm\\'s aftermath; and a woman in Corozal who lacked access to medical treatment. (Two deaths we highlighted were later added to the Puerto Rico government\\'s list of official hurricane-related deaths).Still, I didn\\'t expect deaths would continue into 2018. It\\'s impossible to use statistics to prove that they are, because the Puerto Rican Demographic Registry has not released data for this year. (CNN and Puerto Rico\\'s Centro de Periodismo Investigativo are suing that agency for access to death records). Trends suggest the aggregate loss of life in Puerto Rico is slowing and may have normalized, Santos told me. Still, I was able to document several deaths that occurred this year and appear related to Maria\\'s frantic aftermath. Several of the deaths I researched occurred in Maunabo. Braulio Salinas Santiago, 71, died of an apparent heart attack in the parking lot of Maunabo\\'s makeshift hospital on January 18, according to his wife, Margarita Baerga Diaz. It was about 5 a.m., she said, before the hospital, which operated 24-7 before the hurricane, had opened. Similarly, Fulgencio Velazquez Chevalier died on February 20 in the car of his wife, Litza Rodriguez Figueroa. The 50-year-old suffered depression and intense anxiety after the storm, according to Rodriguez Figueroa, who is a nurse. She believes that stress, along with a related increased smoking, contributed to her husband\\'s cardiac arrest. When she drove by the closed Maunabo hospital, she told me, Velazquez was still alive. Carmen Rodriguez Martinez died on January 25 at age 71. Her doctor, Arturo Torres Borges, wrote two words on the death certificate in a spot reserved for circumstances that may have contributed to the death: \"Huracán Maria.\" The causes of death included respiratory failure and heart disease. Héctor Pedraza, left, lost his mother -- Herminio Trinidad\\'s wife -- when she died in February in the aftermath of Maria.Rodriguez Martinez required an oxygen machine to breathe, according to her daughter, Iris Janette de Jesus Rodriguez, 54. They still didn\\'t have electricity from the grid when I visited in late February. A generator hadn\\'t been enough, she said.In Corozal, farther into the mountains, Victor Manuel Belen Santiago wept as he told me that his mother, Zoraida Santiago Torres, 58, had saved his life by helping him kick drug addiction. Their home was destroyed by the storm, and Belen Santiago rebuilt it by hand, puzzling scraps of the roof and walls together like a reassembled house of cards. But he couldn\\'t restore the power his mother needed to run an oxygen machine. She died on February 13, he said, after getting fluid in her lungs that could not be cleared. Her death certificate lists organ failure and a bacterial infection among the causes of death, along with chronic liver disease. After the loss, Belen Santiago said he contemplated suicide. His beloved mother was gone. He had no job -- no prospect for a job after the debt crisis, which struck Puerto Rico before the hurricane. It was unclear if life ever would feel safe again. \"We are the forgotten people,\" he said. \"It\\'s like we don\\'t exist.\" * * * * *The morning of January 5 started like so many others, with a tap-tap-tap of her father\\'s cane on the second-story patio -- Natalio Rodriguez\\'s way of waking his daughter up for the day. Lourdes Rodriguez rolled her eyes playfully and walked upstairs to see what he wanted this time. She and her two children, ages 13 and 8, had been sleeping on twin beds in a room downstairs since the storm. The roof of a new home they had been building was torn off by Maria.She would awake to her father\\'s screams the following night, but this day now occupies a different territory in her memory. She considers it one of the best days of her life. Her father seemed so healthy, so alive. He wanted to go everywhere that day, see everything. He carried his cane with him while visiting his sister, a nun, in Ponce, a city on the south coast. But he kept it in his elbow crease -- more ornament than crutch. At an ice cream shop, he pretended to be a clueless American tourist -- using affected Spanish, asking to see tourist attractions on the other side of the island. The store\\'s workers laughed when he broke the gag, Lourdes Rodriguez said. He ordered his favorite flavor: passion fruit with pineapple. That night, they ate seafood at a restaurant near the beach.In March, power lines were still twisted and broken in southeastern Puerto Rico. Now, Lourdes Rodriguez wonders why that day was different.Maybe it was the upcoming holiday? January 6 is Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico, or Epiphany, when Christians commemorate the arrival of wise men visiting the infant Jesus. Her father had been talking about it for some time, telling her children to prepare their best clothes (the truth was that most of their clothing had been donated after the storm) so they could go to a pig roast in a neighboring community. In years past, they\\'d gathered up guitars, pots and sticks and gone caroling up and down the hillside -- a Puerto Rican parranda -- growing the party as they visited one house and then the next, offering food and drinks and collecting stories.Maybe he was living in anticipation of that day? Or maybe this day was his way of saying goodbye. * * * * *What\\'s taking so long? That question nagged at me as I reported on Puerto Rico\\'s ongoing electrical outages. And it\\'s a question that clearly haunts many Puerto Ricans.Experts offered some theories.\"They\\'re Americans but they\\'re not represented in Congress,\" said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University in New York. That means there are few political repercussions for a botched disaster response, he said, and few advocates for funding. \"It really gets down to money and poverty and politics.\"\"It\\'s unconscionable and unreasonable that it has taken so long\" to restore power, he said. \"You have to ask yourself, \\'why is that?\\' It\\'s money and politics, the common denominator for so many things. ... Can you imagine no (electric) power in Beaumont or Port Arthur or Rockport, Texas, for this amount of time? I don\\'t care what kind of disaster it was. You would never see this.\"Byrne, the FEMA official, said this disaster has been adequately funded and the federal government is responding to the crisis in Puerto Rico in the same way it would in the 50 states. \"We\\'re not leaving,\" he said. \"We\\'re here until we take care of all of the requirements that are needed.\"As of March 15, FEMA had spent $1.1 billion in Puerto Rico; $1.6 billion in Texas; and $993 million in Florida for individual assistance following the fall 2017 hurricanes. \"That\\'s the initial, quickest payment to individual citizens for immediate needs, but the real cost is in long-term recovery dollars for infrastructure projects, like buildings, roads and other public facilities,\" which is not included in those figures, said Chris Currie, director of emergency management issues at the US Government Accountability Office. Congressional appropriations for disaster response and recovery in recent months are not always itemized by storm, he said, making it difficult to say which hurricanes ultimately will be given the most federal funding. An estimated $23.2 billion has been appropriated specifically for Puerto Rico, according to The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates Maria caused $90 billion in damages; Harvey, $125 billion; and Irma, $50 billion.Regardless of financing, the relative slowness of the recovery in Puerto Rico is seen by some people here as dehumanizing.Life is returning to parts of San Juan, the capital, but hurricane damage remains.In a way, Maria has revealed the ugly colonial relationship between the island and the United States, said Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, a historian and director of the research center at the University of Puerto Rico\\'s school of communications. \"This raw nerve of colonialism comes creeping in in every conversation\" these days, she told me. \"It\\'s this feeling of subordination. The people -- common people -- have no way (to respond) except to wait. Wait for this letter. Wait to see if FEMA comes to town. Wait to see if the federal government comes (though) with the money they told us they would give us for recovery.\"Such frustrations reached a boiling point in the past. There were plenty of other factors at play, but Spain\\'s failure to address a humanitarian and economic crisis after an 1867 hurricane in Puerto Rico \"provided the context for the first political movement for independence on the island,\" Stuart Schwartz, a Yale history professor, writes in \"Sea of Storms.\"The uprising, however, was \"crushed immediately,\" said Álvarez Curbelo, from the University of Puerto Rico. Nothing like that ever would be tried today, she said. While Puerto Ricans have worked hard to create a national cultural identity, and while the idea of independence was popular decades ago, few Puerto Ricans in recent years have supported political independence from the United States, according to Florida International University anthropologist Jorge Duany.If anything, Álvarez Curbelo expects Puerto Rico to sink further into \"political paralysis\" and become more US-dependent after Maria.She doesn\\'t see the United States granting Puerto Rico full rights as the 51st state, a move that likely would require the approval of Congress. Remember, she said, this storm follows a massive debt crisis in which the island\\'s government declared bankruptcy. What does Puerto Rico have to offer the United States now? A fiscal oversight board, appointed by the US President, is steering austerity measures. Meanwhile, Puerto Ricans have been taught, generation after generation, she said, to believe that they cannot survive without the help of a colonial power. \"I\\'m not a pessimistic person,\" she told me. \"I\\'m a historian. I tend to be sober. I watch the long trends. But I don\\'t see the light -- in the total sense of the word \\'light.\\' The thing about power is it\\'s a metaphor for the island. The fragility of the energy system -- of the power system -- is the perfect metaphor for our condition: The light comes and goes. There is no sense of future.\"* * * * *The ambulance arrived at 2:18 a.m. on January 6, records show. It was too late. Natalio Rodriguez Lebron died at 1:23 a.m. According to the death certificate, Rodriguez\\'s death was caused by chronic lung disease, hypertension and diabetes. In the notes on that document, a doctor from the Puerto Rico Bureau of Forensic Sciences also mentioned that he was a smoker and obese.That bureau, in San Juan, is the only laboratory in Puerto Rico authorized to classify deaths as hurricane-related. In the months after Maria, the office has come under criticism, including from CNN, for possibly missing dozens if not hundreds of \"indirect\" hurricane deaths. The US government installed three emergency generators in Maunabo to try to re-electrify the town.The official death toll has stood at 64 since early December. In February, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló announced Puerto Rico had enlisted the help of George Washington University to study the mortality that followed Hurricane Maria. That analysis, due out in coming months, will focus on deaths from September through February. To date, Natalio Rodriguez\\'s death has not been classified as hurricane-related. Puerto Rico\\'s Department of Public Safety, which oversees the forensics bureau, did not respond to repeat requests for comment on his death and others in this story. Rodriguez\\'s family believes his death was related to Hurricane Maria. His doctor, Pedro Lopez Lopez, shares that view. Rodriguez\\'s health deteriorated in the conditions Maria left behind, he told me. He saw Natalio about two weeks before his death; and he was \"stable\" then, he said.The body was not delivered to the forensics office until 2:38 the following afternoon, a time that forensics documents confirm. By afternoon, the body had started to decompose. The family was told it would be impossible to have an open-casket service, as is the norm in Puerto Rico. The closed casket was the hardest part of the funeral, a longtime friend told me. \"It was terrible,\" Damian Lopez said. \"If you love someone, you\\'d like to see him for one last time.\"There was also the matter of the expense. The Federal Emergency Management Agency manages a program that can cover some funeral expenses for eligible families after hurricanes. But those deaths typically must be certified as hurricane-related in order to qualify. The Rodriguez family already put $4,000 toward his funeral, a receipt shows. They still owe $1,115. In December, FEMA did grant the family $4,000 for home repairs and $3,000 to replace household items that were damaged in Maria, Lourdes Rodriguez said. Julia Rodriguez told me friends and relatives tried to offer the family money after the storm but that her husband turned away the help. He was a proud person, she said, and generous. He also knew that everyone in the community was suffering.* * * * *People will keep dying until power is restored. That\\'s the stark assessment Arturo Torres Borges shared with my colleagues Leyla Santiago and Khushbu Shah, who tipped me off to the possibility of continued deaths in Maunabo. Torres is the medical doctor who wrote \"Huracán Maria\" on the death certificate of a local woman.Natalio Rodriguez\\'s doctor puts it this way: \"This is a public health crisis.\" I met plenty of people at risk in Maunabo.Some are so sick of the situation they try to laugh it off.Zoraida Santiago Torres, 58, died February 13. Her family members believe a lack of electric power contributed to her death.Across the street from Litza Rodriguez Figueroa, whose husband died in February, lives Ana Ramos Davila, a 74-year-old who will insist you drink her bottled water and then ask if you have any cute gringo friends who would drink Coors Light and play dominoes with her. That\\'s the dream! she said -- gringos, Coors and dominoes. Post-Maria has included little of that. \"Christ! When is this going to be over?\" she said of the storm. \"I\\'ve spent $100 or more just on bags of ice\" to try to keep food cool without power. \"No one is helping me, my dear.\" \"I already told my psychologist if you get a call that I took my life, don\\'t be amazed,\" she said, serious. \"I\\'m so tired of this -- looking for supplies, finding water, lighting candles. I\\'m so tired.\" A few houses up the street, I met David Torres and Juanita Guzman, who were having their home repainted. Torres showed me a breathing machine he\\'s supposed to use at night but doesn\\'t, he said, because it requires a steady power source and could short circuit without one. He has a small generator -- \"I use it to turn on one light and one fan; if I turn on the light, I have to turn off the fan.\" It doesn\\'t provide steady enough power to run the machine, he said. \"I need my oxygen mask. One of these days my wife is going to wake up and find me dead by her side,\" he said. \"She told me that in the night she hears me having trouble breathing.\" \"If it\\'s my time to die, I\\'ll die,\" he said, laughing. \"There\\'s nothing I can do.\"Experts say post-storm stress and depression can be deadly. Poverty exacerbates the risks, said Redlener, from Columbia University. The way people interpret a disaster matters, too. If they believe the disaster is simply weather-related rather than manmade, they\\'re more likely to accept it, said Peek, from the University of Colorado. What she fears is that Puerto Ricans are struggling because of the human response to the hurricane. \"It\\'s like the despair effect,\" she said. \"People who feel forgotten and neglected -- they may suffer negative mental health effects.\"Up the hill from the Rodriguez family live Miguel Amaro Leon, 79, and Maria Morales Ortiz, 76. They welcomed me onto their outdoor patio just as the sun was setting. A generator roared behind our conversation as they told me how hard it\\'s been to keep the thing running. \"It\\'s been really difficult because we have to pay for the gas,\" Amaro Leon said. \"We only use the generator three or four hours daily. If not, we would have to spend more money.\" Can they keep their insulin cold?\"More or less.\" \"We try to eat food that doesn\\'t need to be in the refrigerator.\" As we talked, the generator ran out of gas.Frogs chirped in the night. \"Things are getting better little by little,\" Amaro Leon said. \"We just need power.\" * * * * *On my last evening in Maunabo, Lourdes Rodriguez took me to see her father\\'s grave. It\\'s in a cemetery in the valley, not far from the town plaza. Looking across the property, you can see the foggy mountains in the distance where so many of Lourdes\\' relatives cut sugar cane and plowed the earth, first under the rule of the Spanish and now the United States commonwealth. Natalio \"Pepito\" Rodriguez Lebron died on January 6.Tears streamed down her cheeks. Her father\\'s family nickname -- \"Pepito\" -- was written by hand in wet cement. The family hasn\\'t been able to pay for a headstone. \"I can\\'t fix it,\" she said, sobbing. \"It\\'s hard for me to see it that way.\"Álvarez Curbelo, the professor at the University of Puerto Rico, told me earlier that she wished Hurricane Maria\\'s dead could speak. That way they would not be ignored. I asked Lourdes what she thought her father would say if he could talk with us now. \"He would tell us to keep calm,\" she said, somber. \"That was always his saying: \\'Take it one day at a time.\\' Don\\'t think about the next week or the next month. \"Take it one day at a time.\"  Editor\\'s note: This is the first of two stories on the religious beliefs of the presidential nominees. Read about the faith of Hillary Clinton here. (CNN)Donald Trump was ashamed -- contrite even -- as he spoke to Paula White hours after the video of him bragging about groping women was released.\"I heard it in his voice,\" said White, a Florida pastor who, outside of Trump\\'s family, is his closest spiritual confidant. \"He was embarrassed.\" In the video from 2005, Trump admits to hitting on a married woman and boasts that he can wantonly kiss women and grope their genitals because he is a \"star.\" During his phone call with White, the GOP nominee said he regretted his remarks and was grateful for the evangelicals still supporting him. Later that evening, he publicly apologized in a video that was remarkably free from the usual rituals enacted by disgraced politicians. Trump didn\\'t stand beside his wife, Melania. He didn\\'t ask for forgiveness. He didn\\'t lament that he had fallen under sin\\'s sway but that by God\\'s grace and with his family\\'s support he hoped to earn a second chance. In fact, Trump didn\\'t mention faith, family or reconciliation at all.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDSpiritual adviser: Trump more devout than you\\'d thinkReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSpiritual adviser: Trump more devout than you\\'d think 04:03\"If he suddenly came out all religious, that would seem staged to me,\" said White, who has known Trump for 14 years. \"Donald has never been public about his faith, and when he has tried, it has been futile. It\\'s not his language, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not his heart.\" For much of the 2016 presidential campaign, religion has receded into the background, mainly because the two major party nominees -- Trump and Hillary Clinton --  rarely talk about their faith. Trump is a professed Presbyterian; Clinton a Methodist.  But two-thirds of Americans have said it\\'s important for the president of the United States to have strong religious convictions, according to the Pew Research Center. And nearly 40% say discussion of religion has been lacking in this election cycle. Beyond the policy discussions and ad hominem attacks, it seems, Americans want to know where candidates\\' moral compasses point. Trump\\'s attempts at public religion have been awkward, at best. He said he does not ask for forgiveness and \"does not bring God into that picture\" when he makes mistakes. He has tried to put money in the Communion plate and referred to the sacrament as \"my little wine\" and \"my little cracker.\" He mispronounced a book of the Bible, and when asked about his favorite verse, has either deferred or, in one case, cited \"an eye for an eye,\" an Old Testament revenge scheme specifically condemned by Christ. (Turn the other cheek, Jesus said.) Trump tussled with the Pope and was shushed by a minister in Detroit. He often looks uneasy when pastors lay their hands on him and pray. He says he is proud of his evangelical support but not sure he deserves it.   When asked theological questions, Trump often speaks in terms so vague they approach opacity.Asked \"Who is God to you?\" by the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump answered \"God is the ultimate,\"  then began a brief spiel about how he got a great deal on a golf course before circling back to his original definition. \"So nobody, no thing, no there\\'s nothing like God.\"  Trump\\'s broad language often serves a purpose, says Michael D\\'Antonio, author of \"The Truth About Trump,\" a biography. \"Donald keeps his options open. He make things mysterious and unclear so that he can say anything else at another time.\" Trump\\'s supporters have a different explanation. Trump is a businessman, not a pastor. He doesn\\'t have practiced answers about religious questions, nor should he be expected to, they say. But that doesn\\'t mean he\\'s irreligious. (Trump\\'s campaign did not respond to several interview requests.) \"I think people are shocked when they find out that I am Christian, that I am a religious person,\" Trump writes in \"Great Again,\" a book published during the presidential campaign. \"They see me with all the surroundings of wealth, so they sometimes don\\'t associate that with being religious. That\\'s not accurate.\"Positive thinking Trump\\'s father, Fred Trump, embodied the Protestant work ethic to an extreme. The real estate developer took his children to construction sites, even on Sundays. Life is a competition between killers and losers, he taught them, and you had to be ruthless to survive. Mary Trump, Donald\\'s mother, tried to instill traditional Christian values in her children, her son has said. She shooed them to Sunday school at First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. Trump proudly displays his confirmation photo from the church, pulling it out to demonstrate his Christian bona fides.  In the mid-1960s, like many upper-middle class families, the Trumps, including teenaged Donald, became attracted to a popular preacher named Norman Vincent Peale. Peale was the pastor at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, whose steeple has soared above 5th Avenue since the 1600s. Peale was far more famous, though, as the multimedia juggernaut who preached the \"power of positive thinking.\" In his books and lectures, Peale married pop psychology with hopeful insights gleaned from the gospel. Sin and guilt were jettisoned in favor of \"spirit-lifters,\" \"energy-producing thoughts\" and \"7 simple steps\" to happy living. \"Attitudes are more important than facts,\" Peale said, and he exhorted his followers to bend the world to their will through mental exertion. \"Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding,\" Peale writes in \"The Power of Positive Thinking.\" \"Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade.\"Published in 1952, Peale\\'s \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" has sold millions of copies and spent 186 weeks atop The New York Times\\' bestseller list. The famous and affluent flocked to Marble Collegiate. \"It was a celebrity church, and its members, in those days, were generally wealthy New Yorkers of the Protestant executive class,\" said D\\'Antonio, the Trump biographer. \"It was a place to see and be seen.\" It was also a place to buy Peale\\'s many promotional materials. Long before entrepreneurial pastors like Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes marketed their sermons as spiritual self-help, Peale sold record albums and pamphlets with titles like \"How to Stop Being Tense\" and \"No More Gloomy Thoughts.\" He was also an enthusiastic champion of the free market, writing columns such as, \"Let the Church Speak Up for Capitalism.\" His parables were often about businessmen who had bulldozed their way to the top, not Samaritans who crossed the street to help a stranger.   The Rev. Michael Brown, senior minister of Marble Collegiate, said there were two Norman Vincent Peales: One was the motivational speaker who tried to reach all Americans. The other was a pastor who preached the redemptive message of Jesus.7 types of evangelicals -- and how they\\'ll affect the presidential race \"Out there in civic centers he would say, over and over, \\'You can, if you think you can,\\'\" Brown said. \"In the pulpit of our church he would quote Philippians 4, \\'You can do all things through Christ.\\' \" But other Christians accused Peale of peddling jingles, not the gospel, worldly success instead of salvation, and simplistic solutions at a time of increasing complexity. \"He promises quick, painless, and complete \\'solutions\\' to problems which may be deep and complex, and which may require real discipline and professional treatment,\" wrote religious studies professor and journalist William Lee Miller in 1955.  Nevertheless, Donald Trump loved Peale\\'s preaching, especially his stories about businessmen surmounting obstacles. \"He would instill a very positive feeling about God that also made me feel positive about myself,\" Trump writes in \"Great Again.\" \"I would literally leave that church feeling like I could listen to another three sermons.\" Trump and Peale became close. Peale officiated at Trump\\'s first marriage, to Ivana, and at the funeral services for his parents. \"He thought I was his greatest student of all time,\" Trump said. The businessman credited \"the power of positive thinking\" for helping him rebound in the 1990s, when his casinos were tanking and he owed creditors billions of dollars. \"I refused to be sucked into negative thinking on any level, even when the indications weren\\'t great.\"Trump\\'s book titles evoke Peale\\'s brand of pop psychology. There\\'s \"Think Big,\" \"Think Like a Champion\" and \"Think Like a Billionaire.\" In another book, \"Never Give Up,\" Trump gives an example of how he put the power of positive thinking into practice. Scouring the newspapers for real estate deals, he found a rundown property in Cincinnati, which he bought from the Federal Housing Administration. The complex had a reputation for \"rent runners,\" Trump writes, so he hired 24-hour patrols, spruced up the place and hired a \"politically incorrect\" project manager. When the surrounding area got \"rough,\" Trump sold the complex, reaping a $6 million profit. \"Creative, positive thinking can be a powerful source of success,\" he wrote. Preaching prosperitySome years ago, after services at her Florida megachurch, Paula White received a call from Donald Trump. At the time, White\\'s star was rising. She co-pastored a Tampa megachurch with 25,000 members and hosted a show broadcast on Christian television. White says Trump told her he was a fan from afar and quoted three of her recent sermons back to her. He asked the pastor if she ever traveled to New York. In fact, she led a Bible study for players on the New York Yankees. The pastor and businessman met at Trump Tower and began what White calls a \"14-year conversation about God and love and a plethora of things.\" White hesitates to reveal much about her relationship with Trump, citing the expectation of privacy between clergy and their congregants. She won\\'t, for instance, say whether she \"led Trump to Christ,\" a claim made this summer by some evangelical activists. \"This is an ongoing walk in his life,\" White said. \"But he is a Christian, and he is born again.\"For his part, Trump has called White \"a beautiful person both inside and out.\"\"She has a significant message to offer anyone who will tune in and pay attention. She has amazing insight and the ability to deliver that message clearly as well as powerfully.\"In some ways, Trump\\'s attraction to White seems unsurprising, said Kate Bowler, a historian at Duke Divinity School and author of \"Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel.\" \"She\\'s blonde and cute and perky and endlessly optimistic.\" Like many prosperity gospel preachers, appearance is part of White\\'s appeal. She favors form-fitting, fashionable attire, often stalking the stage in stiletto heels. In the many glamor shots on her social media accounts, she is perfectly coiffed and impeccably made up. Like Norman Vincent Peale, White preaches a message of boundless optimism and has a strong entrepreneurial streak. She encourages adherents to \"partner\" with her ministry for a monthly fee and sells DVDs of her sermons for $50 a pop. Such endeavors can be lucrative. According to an audit made public by a Senate committee investigating televangelists, White\\'s former church, Without Walls International, took in $150 million between 2004-2006.  At one time, White and her then-husband owned an airplane and several multimillion dollar properties, including a condo in Trump Tower. In 2008, Trump appeared on her television show, where he said his secret of success was the work ethic instilled by his father. \"That\\'s the principle I teach,\" White answered. \"Find your passion and figure out a way to make money.\"  Like Trump, White has seen her share of personal and financial troubles. She has been married three times. (Her current husband is rocker Jonathan Cain, the keyboard player for Journey and a co-writer of the epic hit \"Don\\'t Stop Believin\\'.\")After White\\'s divorce from her second husband in 2007, the church they led together faltered and plunged into bankruptcy. Still, White\\'s sermons remain relentlessly upbeat. Though she rejects the prosperity gospel label, White preaches many of its central tenets on her show \"Paula Today\" and at her new megachurch in Orlando.  White believes the world abides by spiritual laws, Bowler said, one of which is called \"seed faith.\" The idea: By pledging money to a minister, believers sow a seed, and God will reward them with a bountiful harvest, usually in the form of health and wealth. \"Every time we give, something supernatural happens,\" White says in one sermon. Other Christians call this heresy. Faith is not a spiritual investment that guarantees automatic returns, and there is no evidence, anyway, that God wants people to become millionaires. In fact, the gospel famously said it\\'s hard for rich men to enter heaven.  Many of the Christians who have criticized White also question Trump\\'s religious commitments. In his personal life, he has owned casinos, been married three times and boasted about extramarital affairs. During the presidential campaign, he has denigrated Muslims, Mexicans and women. Christianity Today, the flagship magazine for evangelicals, called Trump \"an idolater\" and \"the very embodiment of what the Bible calls a fool.\" A Christian columnist said Trump\\'s \"obsession\" with wealth and power \"embodies a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one.\" The Pope himself said that anyone who talks about building walls instead of bridges \"is not Christian.\" Even Richard Land, a member of Trump\\'s evangelical advisory board, says the candidate he\\'s backing may not be a Christian. \"When a person says that they have never felt the need to ask for forgiveness, they have defined themselves out of the Christian faith as I understand it,\" Land said. White says those criticisms miss the mark. Trump isn\\'t perfect, but nobody is, and he is on the right path, she said. \"I have seen change in him over the 14 years I have known him. He is a growing Christian.\" White also said she sees a side of Trump obscured from outsiders. \"I remember him calling me up one morning and saying, \\'Paula, I know God says to forgive. But how do we know when to turn the other cheek and when to fight?\\'\"\"If he was coldhearted and had no desire or hunger for God, he would not have asked a question like that,\" White says. Several years ago, White brought a friend, Debra George, to Trump Tower. George runs a ministry for prostitutes and children in impoverished inner cities. \"Aren\\'t you scared to go into those areas?\" George recalled Trump asking. She said no, most people are happy to see her, since she comes bearing gifts and asks for nothing in return. George said Trump immediately cut her a check for $10,000 and followed with two more donations of $5,000 each. The two have kept in touch, she said, with Trump asking George to send him her sermons, and George responding with updates on her ministry. \"He has shared with me how much he loves God and loves Jesus,\" George said.Faith vs. works On a conference call with his campaign\\'s evangelical advisory board earlier this summer, Trump earned a trip to the theological woodshed.  He joked that repealing an IRS rule that prohibits pastors from endorsing political candidates might be his only route to heaven.It\\'s a line he has repeated often on the trail, but on this occasion he was immediately rebuked, said Land, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary. (Another member of the board confirmed his account.)\"Mr. Trump, with all due respect, the only way to get into heaven is by accepting Christ\\'s atoning sacrifice for your sins, and accepting him as your personal savior,\" a pastor interjected. Trump quietly agreed and quickly moved on, according to people on the line. Perhaps without knowing it, Trump had stepped into one of Christianity\\'s oldest fault lines: faith versus works.  Protestants like the evangelicals on Trump\\'s board stand firmly on the \"faith\" side. No amount of good deeds will save your soul, they say, if you don\\'t assent to the proper Christian beliefs. Catholics and other Christians mostly agree, but also say that faith without works is dead. Even some evangelicals now say the pendulum has swung too far in the \"faith\" direction, with many Americans claiming to be Christians while refusing to demonstrate Christian behavior. The Book of Bernie: Inside Sanders\\' unorthodox faith In the new book \"You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit,\" James K.A. Smith, a Christian philosopher, tries to rescue the ancient notion that we are defined by our daily dispositions, routines and disciplines. Rather than sequester \"religion\" as something we do on Sunday, Smith argues that our habits -- he calls them \"liturgies\" -- form \"grooves in our soul.\" \"The patterns of your life tell you a lot about your priorities,\" Smith said. The late writer David Foster Wallace sounded a similar theme in \"This is Water,\" a commencement address he gave in 2005. \"Everybody worships,\" Wallace said. \"The only choice we get is what to worship.\" Smith was reluctant to pass judgment on Trump\\'s Christianity. He suggested, instead, taking a look at Trump\\'s daily routines, something Smith calls a \"liturgical audit.\" As it happens, Trump\\'s book, \"The Art of the Deal,\" published in 1987, opens with a \"Week in the Life\" of its author. Back then, Trump was 41, mildly famous and unconsumed by the crazy fire of a presidential campaign. Trump writes that he wakes around 6 each day, reads the papers and arrives at his office around 9. From then until midnight he is on the phone or in meetings, mainly making business deals. \"It never stops, and I wouldn\\'t have it any other way.\"  It isn\\'t all business, though. Trump offers a friend political advice, takes calls from his children and helps raise money to save a farm from foreclosure -- a generous gesture that lands him on the evening news, he notes with satisfaction. In the book, Trump\\'s week ends at 4:45 on Friday afternoon with a visit from David Letterman. Other than a dinner with the late Cardinal John O\\'Connor of New York, there is no religion, no mention of God nor any hint of introspection. \"I don\\'t like to analyze myself,\" Trump told biographer D\\'Antonio, \"because I might not like what I see.\"  In recent years, Trump has said that he attends church occasionally, on Christmas, Easter and \"special occasions,\" but that he is too busy on most Sundays. He is no longer a member of Marble Collegiate or First Presbyterian in Queens, and it\\'s hard to picture him sitting through a service, or confessing his sins before a congregation, or listening, in quiet hours of Trump Tower, for the still, small voice of God. Trump puts his faith in work, and waits upon the whirlwind. Story highlightsNeil Gorsuch\\'s Senate confirmation hearings begin this weekGorsuch was raised Catholic but worships at an Episcopal church No Protestants sit on the Supreme Court Washington (CNN)Earlier this month, the Trump administration summoned two dozen religious leaders to a private meeting. The mission: to rally support for Neil Gorsuch, Trump\\'s Supreme Court nominee.According to several participants, White House staffers emphasized Gorsuch\\'s robust defense of religious rights as a judge on the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals. In one prominent decision, Gorsuch argued that the government should rarely, if ever, coerce the consciences of believers. Eventually, the conversation turned to Gorsuch\\'s own religious background. He was raised Catholic but now worships with his wife and two daughters at St. John\\'s Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado. Like the city, the congregation is politically liberal. It bars guns from its campus and installed solar panels; it condemns harsh rhetoric about Muslims and welcomes gays and lesbians. And its rector, the Rev. Susan Springer, attended the Women\\'s March in Denver, though not as a form of protest but as a sign of support for \"the dignity of every human being.\" Springer says St. John\\'s is carrying out the covenant Episcopalians recite during baptisms: to strive for justice and peace among all people. Her congregation, she added, includes liberals, conservatives and all political points in between.Read More\"What binds us together as one body is a curiosity and longing to encounter and know God,\" she wrote in an email to CNN, \"a willingness to explore our own interior selves, and a desire to leave the world in some small way better for our having been in it.\"As Gorsuch\\'s Senate confirmation hearings began on Monday, some hardline conservatives have raised concerns about his choice of church.\"Be advised,\" blared a tweet from Bryan Fischer, a host on the American Family Radio Network. \"Gorsuch attends a church that is rabidly pro-gay, pro-Muslim, pro-green, and anti-Trump.\" \"Is Gorsuch a secret liberal?\" asked an op-ed in The Hill, a Washington newspaper. Another columnist argued that if conservatives complained about Barack Obama\\'s former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, shouldn\\'t they also grumble about Gorsuch\\'s?At the meeting in Washington, held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House, administration officials encouraged the religious leaders to push back against such questions. St. John\\'s is one of only two Episcopal churches in Boulder, and the other caters to students at the University of Colorado, they said, according to people who attended the meeting. Anyway, Gorsuch should be judged on his judicial opinions, not his pastor\\'s politics, they argued. Many Catholics and evangelicals agree, pointing to Gorsuch\\'s sterling conservative credentials. He is a lifelong Republican and a member of the Federalist Society, a leading conservative legal organization. He has written a scholarly book arguing against assisted suicide and openly admires the late Antonin Scalia, the justice he would replace, a hero to the conservative intellectual elite.  But in the black-and-white world of partisan politics, Gorsuch\\'s writings and religious life show several strands of gray. He studied with an eminent Catholic philosopher but attends a progressive Episcopal parish. He has defended the religious rights not only of Christian corporations but also of Muslims and Native Americans. He has thought deeply about morality, but says judges have no right to impose their views on others. He is hailed as the fulfillment of President Trump\\'s pledge to pick a \"pro-life\" justice, but has no judicial record on abortion itself.  Even Gorsuch\\'s own religion is somewhat of a gray area. If confirmed by the Senate, would Gorsuch be the high court\\'s only Protestant justice, or its sixth Catholic? His close friends and family offer different answers to that question.  A quiet faithGorsuch\\'s father was not conventionally religious, preferring the outdoors to church pews, family members say.\"He showed me ... that there are few places closer to God than walking in the wilderness or wading a trout stream,\" Gorsuch said at his confirmation hearing in the Senate on Monday. His mother, Anne, meanwhile, came from a long line of Irish Catholics. Rosie Binge, Anne\\'s sister and Gorsuch\\'s aunt and godmother, said her parents ferried their seven children to Mass every morning, and dinner was followed by a family recitation of the Rosary. \"I think religion is a big factor in Neil\\'s life,\" Binge said. \"When you grow up with someone so devout, it has to rub off on you.\" The three Gorsuch children -- Neil, Stephanie and J.J. -- attended Mass most Sundays and were enrolled in Catholic schools for much of their early educational lives, family members say. In his speech accepting Trump\\'s nomination to the Supreme Court, Gorsuch briefly alluded to his faith, saying it had lifted him through life\\'s valleys. That was especially true during the early 2000s, said Gorsuch\\'s younger brother, J.J., when their father, David, suffered from an aneurysm and later died, closely followed by his twin sister. Their mother, Anne, died in 2004. \"It was a tough time for the family,\" said J.J. Gorsuch, who worships at a Catholic church in Denver. \"I know that prayer, and group prayer, helped sustain him as well as the rest of us.\"After his parents\\' death, Neil Gorsuch grew close to his uncle, the Rev. John Gorsuch, an Episcopal priest, who died February 15. On a group call following Neil\\'s nomination, family members say, the pastor joked that some of the people on the line were Democrats, but all were proud of his nephew.At his Senate confirmation hearing on Monday, Gorsuch called his uncle \"a hero of mine,\" and choked back tears as he said, \"He gave the benediction when I took my oath as a judge 11 years ago. I confess I was hoping he might offer a similar prayer for me this year. As it is, I know he is smiling.\"When the family moved to Washington, where Anne Gorsuch led the Environmental Protection Agency in the early 1980s, Gorsuch attended Georgetown Prep, a Jesuit school in Maryland.Michael Trent, who has known Gorsuch since they were 14, remembers his close friend as studious but affable, equally at home in the library stacks and outdoors. He kept most of his opinions, including his religious views, private. \"It\\'s important to him, but in the times we\\'ve spent together it has not been a big part of the conversation,\" said Trent, who lives in Marietta, Georgia. \"It\\'s just one those quiet things you understand about a person.\" Gorsuch is godfather to Trent\\'s two sons, whom he spoils with presents on birthdays and Christmas, Trent said. Neil Gorsuch with his godson, Matthew Trent. After college and law school, between stints clerking at the Supreme Court, Gorsuch studied legal philosophy at Oxford University in England, where his dissertation was supervised by John Finnis, a giant in the field and a former member of the Vatican\\'s prestigious International Theological Commission.  Among laypeople, Finnis may be best known for his expositions on natural law, an often-misunderstood area of legal and moral philosophy. At its heart, natural law refers to a body of norms that adherents believe are not created by humans, but instead are revealed through the application of reason, said Richard Garnett, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame Law School, where Finnis now teaches.Because philosophers like Finnis have employed natural law to argue against abortion and same-sex marriage, the field has become controversial, especially among liberals. In 1994, protesters interrupted an address by Finnis at Harvard, calling him a \"hatemonger\" and \"homophobe.\" In a speech at Notre Dame in 2011, Gorsuch spoke fondly of Finnis, saying, \"I have encountered few such patient, kind, and truly generous teachers in my life.\"  Some conservatives celebrate Finnis\\' influence on Gorsuch. But others worry that natural law will become an unwelcome distraction during Gorsuch\\'s Senate confirmation hearings, as it was during those of Robert Bork and Justice Clarence Thomas, both of whom expressed their appreciation for the field. Gorsuch himself drew on natural law while writing his 2006 book \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.\" In it, he argued that \"all human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.\"Conservatives who have read the book say it not only offers indications of Gorsuch\\'s views on assisted suicide, but abortion as well.  \"It is impossible to come away from this rather remarkable book with any conclusion other than that this is a man who has a very high regard for the sanctity and the dignity of human life,\" said Timothy Goeglein, vice president for external relations for the evangelical ministry Focus on the Family. \"I am confident that he will be a pro-life justice,\" said Marilyn Musgrave, vice president of government affairs for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. Despite Trump\\'s pledge to pick a \"pro-life\" justice, Leonard Leo, who advised the president on Supreme Court nominees, said the issue was never explicitly raised during their discussions. Gorsuch\\'s key opinions on religionIn Green v. Haskell County Board of Commissioners, Gorsuch dissented from a decision that forced an Oklahoma town to remove a 10 Commandments monument from the lawn of its courthouse.In American Atheists v. Davenport, Gorsuch joined a minority opinion that argued that a \"reasonable observer\" would not necessarily view crosses erected on public property in honor of Utah state troopers as a government endorsement of religion.In Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, Gorsuch argued that a Muslim inmate can claim that his religious rights were violated by an Oklahoma prison that refused to provide halal food.In Yellowbear v. Lampert, Gorsuch argued that a Wyoming prison violated a Native American prisoner\\'s religious rights by refusing to grant him access to the prison\\'s sweat lodge.In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, Gorsuch wrote a lengthy defense of a Christian family business who said the Affordable Care Act\\'s contraception mandate impinged on their freedom of religion.In Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, Gorsuch joined the dissent in siding with an order of nuns who likewise refused to comply with the contraception mandate, arguing that it violated their religious consciences.\"Judge Gorsuch wasn\\'t asked about it, and he\\'s not going to make a commitment on it,\" said Leo, who has taken a leave from his job heading the Federalist Society while he shepherds Gorsuch\\'s nomination through the Senate.Gorsuch himself cautioned senators against reading too much into his work in moral philosophy when he was nominated to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. \"My personal views, as I hope I have made clear, have nothing to do with the case before me in any case,\" he said. \"The litigants deserve better than that, the law demands more than that.\" In that regard, Gorsuch said he closely follows the man he would replace on the Supreme Court. In a speech shortly after Scalia\\'s death last year, Gorsuch said the \"great project\" of the late justice\\'s life had been to argue for a strict separation of powers between judges and legislators. Lawmakers may appeal to public and personal morality, Gorsuch said, but judges never should. Their job, he said, is to interpret the law, rendering decisions based on what the text says, not what they believe. Other legal scholars say that\\'s unrealistic. No matter how hard judges try, their personal passions and partisan leanings always seep, even unconsciously, into their decisions. Episcopalian or Catholic? When Neil Gorsuch returned from his studies in Oxford, he came home a married man. His British-born wife, Louise, was raised in the Church of England. As the new family settled in Vienna, Virginia, they joined Holy Comforter, an Episcopal parish. According to church records, the Gorsuches were members of Holy Comforter from 2001 to 2006, when they moved to Colorado. But on membership forms, Neil listed his religion as Catholic, and there is no record that he formally joined the Episcopal Church, said the Rev. Lyndon Shakespeare, Holy Comforter\\'s interim rector.  That\\'s not unusual, Shakespeare said. The Catholic and Episcopal churches may differ on politics, but their worship services can be quite similar, and a number of Catholics worship at Episcopal parishes without formally changing their religious identity. The churches recognize each other\\'s baptisms and marriages, but the Catholic Church does not regard celebrations of Holy Communion at Episcopal services as valid, experts say.When the Gorsuch family moved to Colorado, they joined St. John\\'s, where they have been active in Sunday services. Louise is a lay reader, the couple\\'s two daughters likewise assist in the liturgy as acolytes and Neil has been an usher. Friends and family say Louise Gorsuch has an affinity for the liturgy and music at St. John\\'s, finding in it an echo of her upbringing in the Church of England.  \"Many of the hymn texts and musical settings are centuries old, some dating to the earliest centuries of Christianity,\" said Springer, the church rector. \"For people who have been life-long Anglicans, this music ties back to childhood.\" Springer declined to speak in detail about the Gorsuches, but in a recent church newsletter she praised Neil as \"a broad-thinking\" and thoughtful man. In a statement, the congregation of St. John\\'s echoed that sentiment:  \"We know Neil as a man of great humility and integrity, one eager to listen and thoughtful in speaking. These qualities are ones we pray all public servants in any leadership role in our country might possess. We care deeply for Louise and the girls and know them as people of solid faith. We give thanks to God for the presence of this family in our midst.\"Springer said she doesn\\'t know whether Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian. \"I have no evidence that Judge Gorsuch considers himself an Episcopalian, and likewise no evidence that he does not.\" Gorsuch\\'s younger brother, J.J., said he too has \"no idea how he would fill out a form. He was raised in the Catholic Church and confirmed in the Catholic Church as an adolescent, but he has been attending Episcopal services for the past 15 or so years.\" Trent, Gorsuch\\'s close friend, said he believes Gorsuch would consider himself \"a Catholic who happens to worship at an Episcopal church.\" Rosie Binge said her family was surprised to see media reports calling her nephew an Episcopalian. \"I think once you\\'re a Catholic, you\\'re always a Catholic,\" she said, before adding with a laugh, \"At least he\\'s going to church!\" Binge is right about the Catholic Church. Once baptized Catholic, a person enters an unbreakable theological communion, even if he or she later worships in a different church, said William Daniel, a canon law expert at Catholic University in Washington, DC. \"We would say that fundamentally such a person is still Catholic, even if they are living out their life as a Lutheran or Episcopalian. We wouldn\\'t confront the person, but if they asked, we would say: Yes, you\\'re still a part of the Catholic Church.\"    Daniel emphasized that he was not speaking specifically about Gorsuch. Gorsuch could also call himself an Episcopalian if he meets the church\\'s minimum standards for membership: Being baptized Christian, receiving Holy Communion at least three times a year and supporting the church through prayer and financial donations. \"The intent here is key,\" said the Rev. Thomas Ferguson, an Episcopal priest and an expert on its relationships with other churches. \"If he intends to be an Episcopalian he could certainly be considered one.\"This may seem academic, but the religious composition of the Supreme Court is closely watched by many believers. There has not been a Protestant justice on the Supreme Court since John Paul Stevens retired in 2010, and many Protestants eagerly anticipate Gorsuch\\'s confirmation as a religious milestone. Currently, there are five Catholics and three Jews on the high court. \"In the interest of pluralism, it\\'s about time we had a Protestant on the Supreme Court,\" said Richard Land, president of Southern Evangelical Seminary and a member of Trump\\'s evangelical advisory board.\"Would I be happier if he were going to a more traditional Episcopal Church? Yeah, I\\'d be happier for him,\" Land continued. \"But I\\'m more concerned with his views on the Constitution than where he goes to church.\"   Story highlightsThe NRA may seem unstoppable but history says otherwisePolitical pressure groups that seemed unbeatable have lost beforeHistorians cite four examples, two from recent events (CNN)He was a frail, silver-haired man with thick glasses who sold limes on a corner in Miami\\'s Cuban community. But passers-by knew that Orlando Bosch was no ordinary vendor.  Some stuffed $100 bills in his shirt pockets without taking a lime. Others waved Cuban flags and honked their horns as they drove by. Bosch had been linked to at least 50 attacks targeting Fidel Castro\\'s communist regime in Cuba. He once fired a bazooka at a freighter he thought was headed to Cuba. His unyielding hatred of Castro made him a hero to many in Miami\\'s Cuban-exile community.  Bosch\\'s veneration served as a warning to any politician or public figure who ever thought of crossing the \"Cuba lobby\" -- a group of anti-Castro zealots -- by hinting at normalizing relations with Cuba, says Benjamin Bishin, a political science professor at University of California, Riverside. He recounts Bosch\\'s story in his book, \"Tyranny of the Minority.\"  \"Julio Iglesias once said at a Miami night club that he wouldn\\'t mind visiting Cuba, and people booed him off the stage and rioted,\" Bishin says. \"A woman called Castro a great educator, and her office was bombed.\"Then, last December, the Cuba lobby faced an unexpected turn of events: President Barack Obama announced that, after 50 years of hostility, the United States would normalize relations with Cuba. It was a stunning defeat for a group that once seemed invincible.Read MoreFidel Castro, left, with Che Guevara, gave rise to one of the most powerful groups in U.S. politics: the Cuba lobby. \"You couldn\\'t forecast it because you didn\\'t know it was going to happen, but it happens much more than people think,\" Bishin says of powerful political groups that suffer sudden downfalls.  Could the National Rifle Association ever face a similar fate? Most Americans probably don\\'t think so. When a gunman murdered nine people at a community college in Oregon earlier this month, the President seemed to express what many Americans were thinking when he said, \"Somehow this has become routine. ... We have become numb to this.\"  There\\'s a pervasive belief that any attempt to tighten gun laws would be futile because too many politicians are afraid to defy the NRA. But there are at least four examples from American history -- including two snatched from recent headlines -- where ordinary people and unforeseen events defeated a seemingly invincible lobbying group, and hardly anyone saw it coming.The other gun lobby The Cuba lobby\\'s defeat was one such example, Bishin says. After Castro took power in 1959, Cubans who fled to Miami were so passionate about his overthrow that no public figure could propose reconciliation for half a century. This small group of Cuban Americans dictated U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba. But demographics eventually trumped passion.  Older Cubans like Bosch were replaced by a younger generation of Cubans who wanted closer economic and travel ties to their ancestral home, Bishin says. Such a stunning reversal of fortune doomed another organization that was even more powerful than the NRA is today -- a group that one commentator said perfected the art of \"political retribution.\" It was called the Anti-Saloon League.The first political \\'pressure group\\' Cheers erupted across America. People staged rallies and praised God during church services. The Rev. Billy Sunday, a popular evangelist, told a crowd of 10,000 people gathered at a church in Norfolk, Virginia: \"Men will walk upright now, women will smile and the children will laugh. Hell will be forever for rent.\"They were the most powerful pressure group in history.-- Author Daniel Okrent on the Anti-Saloon League Americans were celebrating congressional approval in 1919 of the Volstead Act, which enforced Prohibition. The temperance movement helped make Prohibition possible. But the group that pushed through passage of the 18th Amendment was the Anti-Saloon League, or the ASL. The ASL was led by Wayne Wheeler, who coined the term \"pressure group.\" Under Wheeler, the ASL pioneered lobbying tactics now routinely used by groups like the NRA, says Daniel Okrent, author of \"The Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.\"  \"I\\'m convinced that they were the most powerful pressure group in American history,\" Okrent says. \"They brought about a constitutional amendment.\" Part of its power came from its singular focus. The ASL was interested in only one issue: making America dry. Wheeler forged alliances across party lines, as well as with clergy, populists and the Ku Klux Klan. The group even supported politicians who drank -- so long as they voted for dry laws.  \"They didn\\'t care if you murdered every third child or started a war with Cuba,\" Okrent says, \"if you\\'re on their side against alcohol, they\\'re with you.\"  The ASL used money to control politicians. It raised funds through a network of churches and distributed the cash to any politician who supported anti-alcohol legislation.  At its peak, the ASL had an annual budget that topped $50 million in today\\'s dollars, wrote Bryan Alexander in a 2010 article for Mutineer, a magazine for the fine beverage industry. A look at the money behind the NRA  \"Wheeler donated so much to campaigns that for decades he was the largest single campaign supporter in the United States,\" Alexander wrote. \"He could make or break presidents and hand-pick senators. In any given campaign season, the Anti-Saloon League would contribute as much money to Senate and presidential races as any 12 donors combined.\" The ASL was formed for one purpose, according to its founder, the Rev. Howard Hyde Russell -- \"administering political retribution.\"  The ASL was able to say to any politician: \"Are you with us or are you against us? And if you are against us we will defeat you. And if you are with us we will elect you,\" said Okrent, whose book formed the basis for Ken Burns\\' PBS documentary, \"Prohibition.\"America went dry in 1919 with Prohibition. Authorities poured liquor into the sewers of cities like New York. In 1903, Wheeler gave a ruthless display of public retribution. The ASL targeted 70 Ohio lawmakers who defied the group -- and swept them all out of office in elections. It then successfully mobilized voters to boot Ohio\\'s popular but anti-Prohibition governor, Myron T. Herrick, from power. It was said that, whenever politicians across the country contemplated crossing the ASL, they would warn one another with, \"Remember what happened to Herrick.\"  Even the powerful liquor industry couldn\\'t stop the ASL. Brewers and distillers fought back by bribing politicians, creating lobbying groups that called the temperance movement \"fanatical,\" and surreptitiously paying newspaper editors to run anti-Prohibition articles. But Okrent said they couldn\\'t beat the ASL\\'s singular focus, its coalition-building ability and the religious fervor of its base: churchgoers scattered across America who saw their crusade against alcohol as an \"apocalyptic battle.\"  The ASL could control politicians, but not the unintended consequences of Prohibition, which spawned organized crime and the rise of gangsters such as Al Capone. Fed-up Americans opened up \"speakeasies\" across the country. Pharmacists stocked \"medicinal liquor\" and sold Old Grand-Dad and Johnnie Walker by prescription, while many Americans brewed alcohol in their homes. Even President Warren G. Harding was rumored to keep bootleg liquor in the White House. What really hurt the ASL, though, was the onset of the Great Depression. \"The Depression came on and there was no more tax revenue for the federal government,\" Okrent says. \"People were saying, \\'Where are we going to get the money to keep the lights on?\\' The primary tax revenue before Prohibition was alcohol.\" Prohibition ended in 1933 with the ratification of the 21st Amendment. And so did the ASL. \"By the middle 1930s, it was a toothless organization,\" Okrent says. Wheeler died of exhaustion at age 58 in 1927. When Prohibition was passed, people predicted he would be remembered as one of the most important people in America\\'s history. Yet who remembers Wheeler or the ASL today?Big Tobacco gets smoked  If the rise and fall of the ASL seems so long ago, there\\'s another example from recent history where a lobbying colossus took a sudden fall. Remember Big Tobacco?  If you think the United States is filled with guns, it was also once filled with smokers. Check out old Hollywood movies -- the country was once enveloped in a cloud of cigarette smoke. The U.S. was a nation of people happily puffing away, and much of that was due to the power of the biggest cigarette makers, known collectively as \"Big Tobacco.\" They were sitting in front of Congress looking them straight in the eye and saying tobacco doesn\\'t cause cancer and Americans said, \\'You\\'re crazy.\\'-- Matt Hale, Seton Hall political scientist on Big Tobaccco executives Scientific evidence that smoking harmed people\\'s health started to surface as early as the 1950s; some even trace the first hint of trouble back to a German medical student\\'s theory in the late 19th century. But Big Tobacco launched a lobbying campaign that encouraged cigarette consumption through product placement in movies, clever advertising, even marketing cigarettes to children through the infamous \"Joe Camel\" ads.  Big Tobacco insulated itself from science for as long as 50 years. It funded massive advertising campaigns that denied that nicotine was addictive and created \"filtered\" or \"low-tar\" cigarettes that purported to be healthier. The industry even formed a tobacco research council that cast doubt on scientific studies that concluded cigarettes were harmful.  Their advertising tactics may have changed over the years, but one constant remained: Big Tobacco executives consistently refused to admit that cigarettes were a health hazard. Money and deceit, though, can only bend reality for so long.  In 1964, the Surgeon General\\'s Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health released a report that concluded cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer in men.  Congress subsequently required a health warning on cigarette packages. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later issued numerous reports documenting the harmful effects of smoking, and the CDC sponsored gruesome television commercials featuring emaciated smokers warning others not to take up cigarettes. \"Eventually medical knowledge and proof became so overwhelming that no narrative Big Tobacco could come up with could counteract that new narrative,\" says Kathleen Marchetti, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.  Big Tobacco lost because opponents were able to \"reframe\" the meaning of smoking, Marchetti says. It was no longer a cool, lifestyle choice; it became a deadly habit. States and cities instituted smoking bans for offices, bars and restaurants.  Federal officials started raising taxes on cigarettes. Some say that stigmatizing smokers is one of the few socially acceptable prejudices left in America. \"People began to realize that by smoking, they weren\\'t just affecting their own health, but people around them that they cared about,\" Marchetti says. Once upon a time everyone in America seemed to smoke, as portrayed in shows like \"Mad Men.\"  Another tipping point came in 1994. It was a riveting scene carried live on cable television. The top executives of the seven largest tobacco companies stood before Congress, raised their right hands as the cameras clicked, and testified they did not believe cigarettes were addictive.And, asked if smoking caused cancer or emphysema, R.J. Reynolds CEO James W. Johnston said, \"It may.\" Asked if he knew that cigarettes caused cancer, Lorillard CEO Andrew H. Tisch said, \"I do not believe that.\" For some observers, that was the moment Big Tobacco\\'s deceitfulness became evident to millions of Americans. \"They were sitting in front of Congress looking them straight in the eye and saying tobacco doesn\\'t cause cancer,\" says Matthew Hale, a political scientist at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. \"And Americans said, \\'You\\'re crazy.\\'\" Some even predict smoking will eventually vanish in America. In 1964, about 42% of adults in the United States smoked. Today that number is under 18%, according to the CDC.  Big Tobacco has adjusted, though. It\\'s taken its techniques overseas, and sales are growing in Africa, Asia and Latin America. \"They\\'re selling cigarettes in Thailand instead of Tennessee now,\" Hale says.Why this man gives 10% of his income to the NRALessons for today Some may argue that lessons from Big Tobacco and the ASL don\\'t apply in a post-Citizens United landscape where money rules in politics. But some observers cite current events as well. After Cuba, Obama scored another huge foreign policy victory by taking on another political lobbying group that seemed unbeatable. AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby that has been compared to the NRA for its effectiveness, mobilized to scuttle Obama\\'s recent nuclear deal with Iran. Pundits confidently predicted that it had no chance of surviving a congressional vote.  Yet Obama prevailed in what may be his crowning foreign policy achievement. Commentators say AIPAC was defeated as much by its own hubris as by Obama\\'s tactics. The administration outmaneuvered the deal\\'s opponents by getting Congress to agree it could only pass a resolution of disapproval subject to the president\\'s veto -- leaving supporters with the much easier task of needing only 34 Senate votes.  But AIPAC also misjudged public opinion on the deal, not realizing that most American Jews did not see it as an existential threat to Israel. And AIPAC overreached when it tied itself to the Republican Party, observers say. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\'s decision to accept House Speaker John Boehner\\'s invitation and denounce the deal before a joint meeting of Congress backfired. It transformed the deal into a partisan issue, giving Democrats more cover to support it, some commentators said.AIPAC failed to block the nuclear deal John Kerry negotiated with his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif. No one, though, is predicting Obama can outflank the NRA. Its leadership has repeatedly beaten back politicians and public opinion. Americans appear to want at least some changes to gun laws. A poll conducted in July by the Pew Research Center showed that a large majority of Americans -- 79% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats -- favor background checks for gun shows and private sales. But when asked which is more important -- controlling gun ownership or protecting gun rights -- Americans are more evenly divided. According to the Pew survey, 50% favored control vs. 47% for rights. Meanwhile, a CNN/ORC poll in September showed that most Americans think current gun laws are about right or too harsh and doubt that expanded background checks would keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill or convicted criminals. Overall, 41% say existing laws make it too easy for people to buy guns, down from 56% about a month after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary. About half, 49%, say current laws are about right, and 10% say they make it too difficult to buy a gun. The NRA has successfully opposed calls for changing gun laws. Pessimism about any hope for change seems pervasive. One British commentator, referring to the 20 children and six adults killed at Sandy Hook, tweeted:  \"Sandy Hook marked the end of the U.S. gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.\" Maybe. Yet history and even current events suggest that change often comes in unexpected ways.The business of guns The ASL couldn\\'t anticipate the Great Depression, or that Prohibition would spawn the rise of organized crime. Big Tobacco and the Marlboro Man couldn\\'t stare down critics once smoking became reframed as a public health hazard. People like Orlando Bosch slid into irrelevance in Miami\\'s Cuban community as a new generation arose.  Perhaps some of the same forces that brought down Big Tobacco and the Cuba lobby will one day check the power of the NRA.  \"American politics is constantly changing,\" says Hale, the Seton Hall political scientist. \"Things are always moving; it\\'s never static.\" Some have suggested that the NRA will lose power if guns are reframed as something uncool, like cigarettes. Others say driving a wedge between the NRA\\'s leaders and members may work. Meanwhile, some gun rights supporters say no change in laws will ever stop a mass shooting -- that only a good guy with a gun beats a bad guy with one.The prospect of any check on the NRA\\'s power may seem unrealistic when mass shootings take place with numbing regularity and big money rules politics. But then again, the notion that Wayne Wheeler and the Anti-Saloon League would be reduced to anonymity a dozen years after the passage of Prohibition seemed far-fetched to Americans of another era. Editor\\'s note: This is the second of two stories on the religious beliefs of the presidential nominees. Read about the faith of Donald Trump here. (CNN)At a Catholic charity event this month, Hillary Clinton, a onetime Sunday school teacher, made a small but telling theological slip-up.  After trading jokes with her Republican rival, Donald Trump, at the Al Smith dinner in New York, Clinton got serious, praising her Catholic hosts and Pope Francis\\' fights against climate change and inequality. \"I\\'m not Catholic. I\\'m a Methodist,\" Clinton said. \"But one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works.\"That\\'s only half-true. Neither the United Methodist Church nor the Catholic Church teach that believers can work their way into heaven. Good deeds are important, both churches agree, but God\\'s grace is freely given -- and the only means of salvation.  Clinton likely knows this. She\\'s correctly stated the doctrine before, including at a church service in Washington last year.  Read MoreMaybe her salvation stumble was the work of a sloppy speechwriter -- or perhaps, with apologies to Freud, it was a Pelagian slip. (Pelagius was a monk accused of teaching the heresy that humans could earn their own salvation.) Either way, Clinton\\'s remark revealed a deep strain in her religious thought: There are no freeloaders in heaven. \"She didn\\'t believe it was how high you jumped for joy in church,\" said the Rev. Ed Matthews, Clinton\\'s pastor when she lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the 1990s, \"but what you did when you came down.\" The conventional Washington wisdom holds that Clinton is reluctant to talk about her faith, which is partly true. She doesn\\'t often divulge details about her private piety, even while hinting that prayer and pastoral counseling have led her to consequential decisions, such as remaining with her husband, Bill, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998. But during her three decades in politics, Clinton has been quite willing to talk about how her work has been inspired by her Methodist faith. She traces some of her political positions, particularly concerning children and the poor, directly to Christ\\'s commandment to care for \"the least of these.\"  Speaking to an assembly of Methodist women in 2014, Clinton cited the Gospel story of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes to feed a hungry crowd. \"He was teaching about the responsibility we all share, to step up and serve the community, especially to help those with the greatest need and the fewest resources,\" Clinton said. Since then, the Democratic nominee has adopted a Methodist mantra as her unofficial campaign slogan: \"Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you ever can.\"  (The Clinton campaign did not respond to requests to interview the candidate.) Despite these public testimonies, less than 50% of Americans say Clinton is \"very\" or even \"somewhat\" religious, according to the Pew Research Center. A separate survey, by the Public Religion Research Institute, reveals stark religious and partisan divides in how Americans view the presidential nominees\\' faith. Nearly 80% of black Protestants, a traditional Democratic constituency, say Clinton has stronger religious beliefs than Trump; just 28% of white evangelicals, who lean heavily Republican, agree. Evangelicals\\' antipathy toward Clinton runs long and deep, said Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College in Illinois. Clinton\\'s decades-long embrace of feminism and abortion rights clash with many conservative Christians\\' core beliefs. \"Evangelicals see her as the personification of secular, progressive values, and that overshadows any of her self-identified religious practices.\"But many conservative Methodists, even those who disagree with Clinton politically, say her faith appears to be authentic. \"Too often conservatives have been too dismissive of her religious beliefs, which are sincere,\" said Mark Tooley, a Methodist and president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a conservative think tank in Washington.  \"She was shaped by the church and is still committed to it, and you can\\'t understand her political framework without understanding her Methodist background.\"   The \\'University of Life\\' Clinton\\'s father, Hugh Rodham, wasn\\'t a churchgoer, but he was a praying man. \"I still remember my late father -- a gruff former Navy man -- on his knees praying by his bed every night,\" Clinton has said. \"That made a big impression on me as a young girl, seeing him humble himself before God.\"If Clinton\\'s father provided the model for private prayer, her mother demonstrated how to put that piety into public action. Dorothy Rodham was active at First United Methodist Church in Park Ridge, Illinois, a large congregation in a Chicago suburb. She taught Sunday school and regularly raised money for charity, inspiring her daughter\\'s interest in social justice In 1961, when Clinton was a teenager, a youth pastor came blazing into Park Ridge behind the wheel of a red Chevy convertible. The Rev. Don Jones would inspire Clinton to see the world as her parish. Fresh from seminary after a stint in the Navy, Jones gathered the sheltered Methodist youth of Park Ridge and gave them crash courses in the \"University of Life.\" He read them poems by e.e. cummings, introduced them to Christian intellectuals such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Paul Tillich, and asked them to interpret modernist paintings such as Picasso\\'s \"Guernica.\" \"I think it\\'s fair to say,\" Clinton said in 2009 while delivering a eulogy at Jones\\' funeral, \"that next to my parents ... no adult had more influence on my life.\" His challenges were more than intellectual. Jones took his Christian charges into inner-city Chicago churches, where they mingled with black and Latino teens, creating connections with people they might not otherwise have met. Jones encouraged his youth group to babysit for the children of Latino migrant workers and to visit the elderly in nursing homes. Christians aren\\'t supposed to sit quietly in church, hoping to get into heaven, Jones taught; they\\'re supposed to build the kingdom of God on earth. That idea lies deep in the DNA of the Methodist movement, historians say. The early Methodists in 17th-century England earned their name because they were methodical and disciplined about their duties toward God and to their fellow man. John Wesley, founder of Methodism, preached that Christians should practice not only personal holiness but also a \"social holiness.\" \"Methodists have always had a strong sense of social purpose,\" said David Hempton, dean of Harvard Divinity School and an expert in early Methodist history. They advocated against slavery, corruption, public drinking, animal abuse, popular sports and ostentatious displays of wealth. They visited prisoners and the sick, educated children and gave their extra earnings to charity.  Clinton has said that she spent a lot of time as a young person trying to \"work out the balance between personal salvation and the social gospel.\"In 1962, Jones took Clinton and her youth group to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak in Chicago, where the civil rights leader delivered his famous sermon \"Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution.\"  King\\'s challenge struck Clinton like St. Paul on his horse. She left the room that night a changed person, she would later recall.\"His words, the power of his example, affected me deeply and added to the lessons of my minister to face the world as it is, not as we might want it to be,\" Clinton told a group of Baptists in September, \"but to commit ourselves to turning it into what it should be.\"Bill Clinton credits King\\'s speech with changing the trajectory of his wife\\'s moral and political life. \"It took my breath away when I realized 45 years ago that is really what motivates her,\" he said in Iowa this year. At the time, though, Clinton remained a \"Goldwater girl,\" a rock-ribbed Republican like her father. At Wellesley College, she headed the college\\'s Young Republicans Club. But a Methodist magazine, motive, flooded Clinton with progressive opinions -- rooted in liberal Christian theology -- on the Vietnam War and civil rights movement. \"I wonder if it\\'s possible to be a mental conservative and a heart liberal,\" she wrote in a letter to Jones, who\\'d become a lifelong mentor and confidant. By her senior year, Clinton appeared to have completed her political conversion to liberalism, writing her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky, the leftist community organizer.  After college, Clinton says her Christian faith inspired her decision to do public service, rather than apply to white-shoe law firms. At the Children\\'s Defense Fund, she says, she went undercover to expose systemic racism in the deep South and the plight of children with disabilities in New England. Around the same time, she met Bill Clinton at Yale Law School, and eventually followed him to Arkansas, where they married in 1975. Several years later, while raising their daughter, Chelsea, Hillary Clinton joined First United Methodist Church in Little Rock.While Bill attended a Baptist church down the road, Hillary became an active and \"vital part\" of the Methodist congregation, the local bishop later recalled. She volunteered to be the church\\'s chancellor and taught adult Sunday school on the lawn of the Governor\\'s Mansion. The Rev. Ed Matthews, former pastor of First United Methodist Church of Little Rock, recalls one of Clinton\\'s lessons keenly. It was about forgiveness, and how it is not a human quality but rather a gift from God. When Clinton was first lady and facing her own crisis, Matthews said he went to the White House and reminded her of that lesson. The lion\\'s den Soon after the Clintons arrived in Washington, they had dinner at the White House with a few pastors and their families, recalls the Rev. Tony Campolo. Hillary Clinton told the gathering that she reads Scripture daily, so the evangelical pastor asked what passages, in particular, interested her. \"She said, the \\'Book of Daniel,\\' which seemed strange to me,\" Campolo recalled recently. He asked her why. \"She said because the Book of Daniel describes with care how political leaders handle situations under great pressure.\"In the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is about a Jew exiled to Babylon, where he is tossed into the lion\\'s den after his quick political ascent inspires jealousy. If the modern-day parallels aren\\'t immediately obvious to others, they were evidently clear enough to the fresh-from-Arkansas Clintons. Clinton read more than Scripture while in the White House, according to friends and colleagues. She continued to subscribe to motive magazine, which is now out of print, as well as Christianity Today, the flagship magazine for evangelicals. She said she kept a copy of the Methodist \"Book of Resolutions,\" the church\\'s policy statements, in her private quarters of the White House, and regularly read books by Christian authors. She occasionally carried a small book filled with spiritual quotations and another of the Bible\\'s Book of Psalms.\"She has always loved the Psalms,\" said Matthews, the Arkansas pastor. \"I think she relates to their search for meaning, and how the psalmist can change moods, from lamenting how evil the world is, and how everyone is mistreating us, to showing gratitude to God for the beauty of the world.\"  In Washington, the Clintons found a new church home on a snowy Sunday in January 1993. The family was feeling \"stir crazy,\" Clinton recalls, so they trudged several blocks through the blizzard to Foundry United Methodist Church, where they surprised a pastor who had almost canceled services that morning. The Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, Foundry\\'s former pastor, recalls the Clintons attending his church regularly for the next eight years, some 100 or so Sunday services in all. They sat three rows back on the right center aisle, he said, directly in his line of sight from the pulpit. Wogaman, a dignified man and Methodist scholar, said he tried not to preach politics overtly, though he thought carefully about the messages his sermons would send to the first family. He recalls only one overt political statement he made from the pulpit, asking Bill Clinton to carry the congregation\\'s good wishes to the family of assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. Chelsea became a part of Foundry\\'s youth group, as her mother had in Park Ridge, and Wogaman recalls the Clintons attending parents\\' meetings and helping to plan for mission trips to Appalachia. When a member of the congregation fell ill, the Clintons would call the hospital to check up on them, the pastor recalled. The first family walks outside Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington.At a service marking Foundry\\'s 200th anniversary last year, Hillary Clinton said the church was a place where \"we were, not \\'the First Family\\' -- we were just our family.\" \"This community -- because indeed that\\'s what it is -- was a place where we could worship, study, contemplate, be of service, get some good pastoral advice, and step outside all the commotion of life in the White House and Washington. That was very, very precious to us.\"But as the pressures -- and the scandals -- mounted, the first lady also looked elsewhere for spiritual sustenance. Close friends say she keeps her own counsel. She is far more comfortable assuaging a friend\\'s grief or regret than she is asking others for help. But in 1994, after her high-profile health-care reforms foundered and scandal swirled around the White House, the first family decided they needed help from outside Washington. They invited a number of New Age gurus and motivational speakers to Camp David in Maryland. One woman, Jean Houston, particularly intrigued Clinton. Houston describes herself as a \"scholar, philosopher and researcher in Human Capacities.\" One of those capacities, apparently, was the ability to converse with the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt. In the Solarium of the White House, according to Washington journalist Bob Woodward, Houston encouraged Clinton to have brief \"conversations\" with Roosevelt and Gandhi, two revered figures for the first lady. Houston then asked Clinton to address Jesus, according to Woodward\\'s account. That was too personal, Clinton said.Clinton was annoyed when the sessions -- media sensationalists called them \"séances -- were revealed. Her friends and former colleagues say the incident was overblown; it was only an \"imaginative exercise.\"  \"No doubt she admired Eleanor Roosevelt\\'s courage and commitments, but to say that Hillary was having séances or communing with her is just crazy,\" said Melanne Verveer, Clinton\\'s former chief of staff as first lady. The media reaction was reminiscent, Verveer said, of the brutal criticism of Clinton\\'s \"Politics of Meaning\" speech in 1993. In the somewhat rambling address, Clinton did what she so rarely does in public: let her guard down and show her true feelings. Economic prosperity and political freedom aren\\'t enough, Clinton said in the now-infamous speech. She encouraged Americans to dig deeper, to find the \"core level meaning in our individual lives,\" to awaken from their \"sleeping sickness of the soul.\" The press tore her apart. \"Saint Hillary,\" The New York Times mocked. \"Psychobabble,\" another newspaper said. Lissa Muscatine, Clinton\\'s friend and former speechwriter, said the first lady felt blindsided and misunderstood. Her family had just taken Hugh Rodham, Clinton\\'s father, off life support, a moment that stirred big questions in Clinton. \"She was trying to be reflective and thoughtful in a personal way, and she got completely ridiculed. It was painful because she was really trying to say something. Her father was dying; if people are not allowed to be introspective in those moments, then we have no empathy whatsoever.\"Several months later, at a National Prayer Luncheon, Clinton said she was somewhat afraid to address religion again. \"The last time I spoke in public about spirituality, around the time of my father\\'s death, I was astonished to realize that there were many people for whom spirituality should be confined to events like this, and not brought out into the public arena.\" But whatever embarrassment Clinton felt, it would hardly compare with the public humiliation she would soon endure. Forgiveness At a White House prayer breakfast in 1998, President Bill Clinton apologized to the nation and to his family for conducting an affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Couching his confession in Christian terms, the president said, \"I don\\'t think there\\'s a fancy way to say that I have sinned.\"Hillary Clinton sat stoically through her husband\\'s speech, recalled Matthews, the Arkansas pastor, who was sitting a few feet away. When the speech ended, he knelt beside her. \"Are you all right, Hillary?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" Clinton whispered to him, Matthews said.\"Do you remember what you taught me about forgiveness and grace?\" the pastor asked, reminding Clinton of her Sunday school lesson from years ago.Matthews says he doesn\\'t even know if Clinton heard his question, she seemed so distraught and distracted. In her memoir \"Living History,\" Clinton calls the Lewinsky scandal \"the most devastating, shocking and hurtful experience of my life.\" \"I would have to go deep inside myself and my faith to discover any remaining belief in our marriage,\" Clinton writes, \"to find some path of understanding.\" During the scandal, three ministers, including Foundry\\'s Wogaman and Campolo, the evangelical pastor, very publicly ministered to Bill Clinton.  But Hillary took a more private tact.\"Where some people might go to a shrink, she goes to a minister,\" said a friend and former staffer of Clinton\\'s. Clinton turned for counsel, as she often did, to her former youth pastor, Don Jones. Just as he had during the Park Ridge days, Jones pointed Clinton to classic liberal Christian theology, including a sermon by Paul Tillich that they had read together decades earlier. In \"You Are Accepted,\" Clinton writes, Tillich teaches that \"sin and grace exist in life in constant interplay; neither is possible without the other.\" The mystery -- and paradox -- of grace is that you cannot find it on your own; it finds you, often when you are most pained and restless. \"Grace happens,\" Clinton wrote. Another spiritual classic offered lessons on forgiveness. Clinton says she first read \"The Return of the Prodigal Son\" by Henri Nouwen, a Dutch Catholic priest, in 1994. Separately, two friends gave it to her, she writes in \"Living History.\" The book became a \"lifeline,\" she would later say. Nouwen, a well-known spiritual writer, analyzes Jesus\\' story about the prodigal son from several perspectives: the father who forgives his wayward son, the son who returns home after squandering his family fortune, and the dutiful other son who had remained home. Clinton has said the book\\'s emphasis on the \"daily discipline of gratitude\" struck her with the force of epiphany. Even amid Washington\\'s craziness and pitched partisan battles, she had much to be grateful for, said the former first lady. Nouwen was also eloquent on the theme of forgiveness: \"Do I want to be not just the one who is being forgiven, but also the one who forgives; not just the one who is being welcomed home, but also the one who welcomes home ...?\"Clinton has said she might not have made it through the Lewinsky scandal without her faith; Matthews said that without her faith she likely would not have forgiven her husband. \"People say that it was because of money or power or political prestige, and maybe that was a part of it,\" the pastor said. \"But it\\'s her faith that makes her tick.\" DevotionsClinton is still a member of First United Methodist Church in Little Rock, Matthews says, but hasn\\'t been back in years. Though she sometimes attends services at a Methodist church near her home in Chappaqua, New York, her duties as secretary of state and now the Democratic presidential nomination have kept her on the road, and away from regular Sunday worship.But the Rev. Bill Shillady, a Methodist minister in New York, said he has found a way to pastor to the peripatetic Clinton. Shillady met Clinton at a memorial for 9/11 victims in New York in 2002, when she was a senator. He invited her to his former church in Manhattan, and over time the families became close, sharing Easter breakfasts and meals at Christmastime. Shillady conducted Chelsea\\'s wedding and a memorial service for Dorothy Rodham, Clinton\\'s mother.Around Easter in 2015, Shillady offered to send Clinton daily email devotions, which he wakes early each morning to compose. The devotions, which arrive in Clinton\\'s inbox by 5 a.m., include a snippet of Scripture, a brief commentary on the passage and a prayer. In recent months, Shillady has enlisted a team, including a group of young women pastors, to help write the devotions. (Burns Strider, Clinton\\'s friend and faith adviser to her 2008 presidential campaign, also emails spiritual thoughts to the candidate.) Clinton has said she appreciates the efforts, especially during the pressure cooker of a presidential campaign. \"It just gets me grounded,\" she told a town hall in February.Occasionally, Shillady says, Clinton will respond to the devotions. She particularly liked the introduction to \"Lady Wisdom,\" a figure from the poetry in the Old Testament. In the Book of Proverbs, Chapter 8, wisdom is personified as a woman who raises her voice at the crossroads and before the gates to the city. In Eugene Peterson\\'s colloquial translation of the Bible, Lady Wisdom stands at the busiest intersections, the \"corner of First and Main.\"\"So, my sister, use your wisdom that God has given you, to help others to know of God\\'s grace, truth and light,\" Shillady wrote, \"For if anyone is at the corner of First and Main, it is you.\"Loving thy enemiesThroughout her time in Washington, Clinton has surprised conservatives and her liberal allies by crossing the political aisle to participate in bipartisan prayer groups. As first lady, Clinton says, she became close to several members of The Fellowship, a secretive Christian network of Washington power brokers. While in Congress, she shocked some Republicans by joining the Senate Prayer Breakfast. On matters of Christian doctrine, Clinton shares core beliefs with conservatives. She has said she believes in the Holy Trinity, that Jesus\\' death atoned for human sins and that Christ\\'s resurrection was a historical event. She prays regularly and is well-versed in Scripture, citing biblical passages accurately and with ease. And yet, many conservative Christians refuse to recognize Clinton as a fellow believer. Ben Carson has connected Clinton to Lucifer, and a new documentary asks whether she is \"an illuminati or the anti-Christ.\"Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a historian at Calvin College in Michigan, said she was drawn to study Clinton\\'s faith in part to understand why conservative Christians so vehemently deny it. \"Among conservative Christians -- those who most care about bringing their faith to bear on politics -- there\\'s such a long history of if not demonizing Hillary Clinton, then at the very least setting her against everything they hold dear.\" From the moment Clinton stepped on the political stage, she seemed to represent a rejection of conservative Christian values. She dismissed women who \"stay home and bake cookies,\" insulting Christians who hold to \"biblical\" views of submissive women. She was shaped by a church that sees government as a partner -- sometimes to be criticized, but rarely feared as a threat to religious freedom. She participated in the anti-war movement and has affirmed liberal orthodoxies on abortion and other social issues.  Last year, she said that \"deep-seated\" religious beliefs on abortion \"have to be changed,\" a pledge that angered Christians who consider abortion the killing of innocent lives.  Meanwhile, many conservative Christians have created their own subculture, said Du Mez, publishing anti-Clinton books, hosting anti-Clinton radio shows, writing anti-Clinton articles and consuming anti-Clinton TV reports. \"They aren\\'t often confronted with different ways to be Christian in America today. Thus, they assume Clinton must be lying about her faith. Or pandering,\" the historian said.  Of course, Clinton is no mere figurehead. She has been a protagonist in some of the most protracted political scandals in recent history, from her husband\\'s sexual infidelities to her own dissembling about the use of a private email server while secretary of state. According to surveys, many Americans do not think Clinton is trustworthy.Still, as Clinton has acknowledged, politics is a \"rough and tumble\" business, and it\\'s hard to imagine any politician who hasn\\'t found foes along the way. But at a Baptist convention in Kansas City, Missouri, Clinton said that she has been trying to follow Christ\\'s commandment to love her enemies. It\\'s a lesson she remembers well from teaching Sunday school in Arkansas, she said, but some days it\\'s \"really hard\" to put the lesson into practice. It is just as hard, it seems, for Clinton\\'s enemies to love her.   (CNN)Leavenworth Detention Center seems like a prime example of why President Joe Biden wants to close private prisons: So far this year, the federally contracted jail has been the site of multiple stabbings and a fatal beating. Former guards say drugs and weapons are common behind bars -- and for months, many cell doors didn\\'t even lock. A judge called it \"an absolute hellhole\" at a recent sentencing hearing.\\u202f But while the Biden administration is ending contracts with private companies like the one operating the detention center, the Kansas facility and others like it are trying to get around the President\\'s directive and still collect federal money. One key loophole they\\'ve found: holding detained immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Biden signed an executive order his first week in office that banned new private prison contracts, but it didn\\'t apply to immigrant detention centers. A Pennsylvania federal prison owned by the corporate giant GEO Group has reopened as an immigrant detention center, and local officials around the country told CNN prison companies are exploring the same playbook for at least a half-dozen other private facilities with expiring contracts, including possibly at Leavenworth.\\u202f Activists say the moves amount to a broken campaign promise from the President. Read More\"The Biden administration is literally allowing private prison companies to fill beds that were emptied out under the executive order with immigrant detainees,\" said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project. \"These companies are basically playing an end run around the executive order.\" Elsewhere, local or county governments are simply stepping in as middlemen, accepting federal funds to hold federal inmates and negotiating new contracts with the same private prison companies to get around the executive order.  The tactics have led to an uncertain future for prisons like the Leavenworth Detention Center, which was the first maximum-security federal private prison in the country when it opened three decades ago (and is separate from the more well-known government-run federal penitentiary nearby). The detention center\\'s contract, with the prison company CoreCivic, is set to expire at the end of next month.\\u202f Former correctional officers Brenda Lust, left, and Shari Rich both quit after more than a decade working at the Leavenworth Detention Center, as they felt the prison was no longer a safe working environment.Eight current and former correctional officers at Leavenworth told CNN the private jail was putting inmates and staff alike in danger -- allegations that CoreCivic denied. Many of the officers argued the jail shouldn\\'t be allowed to stay open in any form. \"That facility really needs to be completely shut down,\" said Shari Rich, who quit in July after almost 13 years working at the detention center. \"Our families are very glad we\\'re out of there.\" Despite campaign promise, Biden order excluded ICE  Closing private prisons has been a long-standing goal for liberal activists -- and Biden\\'s election put it within reach at the federal level. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Justice moved to end its use of private prisons in 2016, following an inspector general report that found federal private prisons were more violent than publicly run facilities. But after President Donald Trump took office, the order was quickly rescinded. Biden reversed course again in January, directing the attorney general not to renew contracts for privately operated detention facilities. His executive order applied only to Department of Justice facilities: about a dozen federal private prisons contracted by the Bureau of Prisons, as well as at least a dozen other private federal jails contracted by the US Marshals Service, which mostly holds pretrial inmates. \\'There\\'s no trust\\': Pro-immigrant groups blasted Biden officials on a call Friday morningThe order didn\\'t include ICE detention centers, which are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security -- even though Biden had pledged on his campaign website that as president he would \"make clear that the federal government should not use private facilities for any detention, including detention of undocumented immigrants.\" That created a significant loophole. George Zoley, the executive chairman of the GEO Group, said during the company\\'s quarterly earnings call on November 4 that in working to reopen the private prisons closed by Biden\\'s order, \"we\\'ve made our facilities known to the ICE officials ... and they are evaluating those facilities.\" Federal contracts for prisons and jails accounted for about a fourth of revenue last year for the two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic and the GEO Group, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, while ICE facilities made up a slightly larger share. Roughly 8 in 10 ICE detainees are held in private facilities.\\u202f The companies objected to Biden\\'s executive order, saying the reasoning behind it was flawed. \"Our efforts are fully aligned with the administration\\'s goal to prioritize rehabilitation and redemption for individuals in our criminal justice system,\" CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said in an email. \"The fact that we\\'ve worked with both Democrat and Republican administrations for the past four decades is a testament to the quality of the services we provide and the genuine need the government has for them.\" The prison companies are also adapting and expanding beyond the detention industry to continue raking in federal contracts. In a stark sign that Biden\\'s order hasn\\'t blunted their business, the two corporate private giants have been awarded more federal money per day during the Biden administration than during the Trump administration, according to a CNN analysis of federal contracting data. Former Leavenworth Detention Center correctional officer William Rogers kept stacks of reports and letters he filed to the prison management documenting his concerns over safety at the prison. Since Biden took office, the federal government has approved more than $888 million in direct payments to CoreCivic, the GEO Group and their subsidiaries -- or about $3 million per day of Biden\\'s administration. That\\'s more than the $2.9 million per day of the Trump administration or $2.2 million per day of the Obama administration. Most of the Biden spending came from ICE. In many cases, the Biden administration is fulfilling contracts originally signed by previous officials, not awarding new deals. But the spending shows how the private prison industry has adapted to the changing political climate: ICE has awarded more than $255 million in payments to a GEO Group subsidiary for ankle monitors and other monitoring services for immigrants in 2021, significantly more than the Trump administration paid for the same program. The monitoring program accounts for the largest private prison company payments of the Biden era. \"The idea of alternatives to detention is being more popularized and receiving support on a bipartisan basis,\" Zoley said on the earnings call. \"It\\'s cheaper and it\\'s effective, and the technology is being continuously improved.\" How prison companies are getting around executive order Across the country, prison companies are trying to get around Biden\\'s executive order in two ways. In some cases, they are working to reopen private prisons as immigrant detention centers. Elsewhere, they are recruiting local governments to act as intermediaries, taking over prison contracts but then passing federal funds on to the private companies.\\u202f So far, one federal prison has reopened for ICE. The Moshannon Valley Correctional Center, in central Pennsylvania, closed at the end of March, and in late September the GEO Group and ICE signed a contract with the county to reopen the facility as an immigration detention center. While local activists and immigrant advocates criticized the deal, John Sobel, the chairman of the Clearfield County Board of Commissioners, said that it worked out well for his community. In addition to saving roughly 300 jobs at the prison, the county will receive an annual fee of $200,000 under the contract, he said.\\u202f \"It\\'s a very rare occasion when an entity closes and jobs are lost that you\\'re able to restore them within such a short time,\" Sobel said.\\u202f Moshannon likely won\\'t be the only facility to see such a conversion -- prison companies are exploring the possibility of reopening other closed prisons to hold immigrants, local officials around the US told CNN.\\u202f In Tipton County, Tennessee, the CoreCivic-run West Tennessee Detention Facility closed in September after its contract with the Marshals Service ended. Before the prison closed, local officials were already in negotiations with ICE and CoreCivic about the possibility of an immigration detention center, according to county records.  Jeff Huffman, the county executive, said that CoreCivic wanted \"to use the county as a passthrough\" for ICE, although the details are still being negotiated. He said he thought locals would support an immigrant detention center due to the economic impact of the facility remaining shuttered.\\u202f \"I don\\'t know what you do with a closed prison that\\'s growing up in johnsongrass and weeds,\" he said.\\u202f CoreCivic, one of the largest private prison companies, runs the Leavenworth Detention Center.And in Big Spring, a small West Texas city that\\'s home to the GEO Group\\'s Big Spring Correctional Center, Mayor Shannon Thomason said his city has reached out to both ICE and the US Department of Health and Human Services about the possibility of converting the private prison into an immigrant detention center or a facility for unaccompanied immigrant minors after its contract expires at the end of this month. \"ICE has expressed an interest,\" Thomason said. \"If we do go as an immigrant detention facility, my intent is for it to be a model detention facility.\" Other communities, however, have turned down prison companies\\' pitches for immigrant detention. In rural Hinton, Oklahoma, the Bureau of Prisons ended its contract with the GEO Group-run Great Plains Correctional Institution, which closed in May.\\u202f With the prison closed, the town lost about 230 jobs, as well as $1.5 million a year in utilities and fees, according to local officials. Because of the lost revenue, the Hinton government cut one of its six police officer positions as well as its only code enforcer, said Shanon Pack, the town administrator. But Jason Garner, the head of the local economic development agency that contracts with GEO to run the prison, said that the company\\'s proposal to revive the facility for ICE was a nonstarter. GEO \"wanted to use it as a processing facility for illegal immigrants,\" Garner said. \"They worked on a contract for that, but we didn\\'t like the idea because they were going to process the detainees and release some of them into the community.\"  In Youngstown, Ohio, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, a Marshals Service jail run by CoreCivic, was originally set to close in late February, when its contract expired. But the Marshals Service inked a deal with the Mahoning County Sheriff\\'s Office to keep it open: The feds pay the county, then the county pays CoreCivic. Even though the jail is still run by a private company, the company never signs a contract directly with the federal government -- and avoids running afoul of Biden\\'s order.  A similar arrangement is being negotiated for the Western Region Detention Facility in San Diego, another Marshals Service jail run by the GEO Group. While its contract was supposed to expire at the end of September, it was granted a six-month extension, and GEO is in talks with the city of McFarland -- 250 miles north of the facility -- to serve as a middleman, according to city records.\\u202f Activists blasted these maneuvers as a blatant strategy to get around Biden\\'s directive. \"It goes against the spirit of the executive order and against the promises Biden made,\" said Setareh Ghandehari, the advocacy director of the Detention Watch Network, an advocacy group. The GEO Group did not respond to specific questions about its contracts but said in a statement that it was focused on providing \"innovative, flexible, high-quality solutions that help our government agency partners address current and future support services and infrastructure needs.\"  The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and Department of Justice and Marshals Service spokespeople did not answer questions about why the contract extensions had been allowed. \"The Department of Justice is carefully examining its existing contracts with these facilities, while also taking care to avoid unnecessarily disrupting meaningful access to counsel, timely court appearances and case resolutions, and access to family visitation and support,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email.\\u202f An ICE spokesperson said all facilities holding its detainees are \"required to follow ICE\\'s stringent detention standards, which help ensure that all detainees are treated humanely.\" Failures at Leavenworth: \\'An absolute hellhole\\'  Just beyond the barbed wire fence that surrounds the Leavenworth Detention Center, a string of \"NOW HIRING\" yard signs and banners advertise a starting wage of $22.75 per hour. But according to guards who work at the jail, which holds up to about 1,000 inmates for the Marshals Service, the recruitment effort is a sign of critical understaffing. In interviews with CNN, eight current and former correctional officers painted a picture of a violent, dangerous prison that spiraled out of control during the coronavirus pandemic.\\u202f Former correctional officer Justin Chmidling holds documentation of reports he filed while working at the Leavenworth Detention Center, including photos of cafeteria trays that he said inmates were using as weapons.The problems start with the jail\\'s most basic function: Many of the doors to individual cells simply didn\\'t lock, after being broken by inmates, all of the guards interviewed by CNN said. Ron Miller, the US marshal for Kansas, confirmed in an interview that broken cell door locks had been a problem in the facility earlier this year but said the issue had been fixed in recent months.\\u202f The prison has also faced near-constant understaffing, the employees say: Single officers would be assigned to staff areas that in past years would be covered by four or more guards, and several key security posts -- known as pod control posts -- regularly went unmanned.\\u202f A scarcity of employees has been a problem at Leavenworth for years, with a 2017 inspector general report finding that up to 23% of correctional officer positions were vacant. But guards said the vacancies increased during the Covid pandemic, as more and more employees quit. Constant turnover also meant that many newer guards receive little training before they start working. Guards said weapons such as improvised shanks and drugs are rampant behind bars, with cell blocks often filled with the acrid smell of K2, a type of synthetic marijuana.\\u202f \"Just walking down the hallway, it feels like you get a contact high,\" said Justin Chmidling, who started as a guard in February 2019. He said he quit in September after the stress of working there made him physically ill. The deadly cocktail of understaffing, drug use and weapons has led to an eruption of violence in recent years. Data provided by CoreCivic to a federal public defender, and included in an inmate\\'s motion for a sentence reduction, show that the number of assaults and uses of force has jumped from 2019 to 2020 and 2021.\\u202fAnd Leavenworth Police Department data shows a similar increase in calls for service to the facility for reports of battery, assault and rape. Many of the problems with the prison have previously been reported by the Missouri Independent, a nonprofit news organization.\\u202f\\u202f Former correctional officer William Rogers said he was assaulted seven times in the detention center over his four and a half years working there, including three times that sent him to the hospital. Documents he provided to CNN show that he and colleagues repeatedly warned CoreCivic higher-ups about violence and security oversights.  \"Right now we seem to have lost control of the jail,\" he wrote in one letter to his warden.\\u202f\"Leaving these posts empty is putting staff at great risk,\" he wrote in another report. But he said that almost none of his missives received a response. \"It\\'s about the profit for them. They don\\'t care to make it better,\" he said in an interview. Rogers was fired last year for violating a use of force policy by pushing an inmate.\\u202f Former correctional officer William Rogers said he was assaulted seven times over four and a half years on the job. In one incident in February, an inmate threw boiling water in the face of a correctional officer, then stabbed, kicked and punched her, according to multiple guards. The inmate also stabbed a second officer as she tried to step in, sending both to the hospital.In August, Leavenworth inmate Scotty Wilson was attacked by another inmate at the facility, who bashed him in the head with a metal food tray. He died two days later.  Wilson was being held at the CoreCivic facility for failing to show up to a halfway house after a previous prison stay. Wendi Anaya-Wilson, his widow, said he had described the prison as \"total chaos,\" telling her in phone calls that inmates \"had to watch themselves and there was no guards and doors didn\\'t lock.\" \"He was only looking at eight to 14 months, but what he got was the death penalty,\" Anaya-Wilson said in an interview. She pulled up photos on her phone from the hospital showing her husband\\'s bruised and bloodied head -- just above his tattoo of the couple\\'s names and faces.\\u202f Wendi Anaya-Wilson and her husband, Scotty Wilson, who died after another inmated attacked him at Leavenworth Detention Center.In a statement, CoreCivic denied \"specious and sensationalized allegations\" that Leavenworth is violent or dangerous, arguing that criticism from former employees and activists is \"designed to exert political pressure rather than to serve as an objective assessment\" of the jail.  Both public and privately run corrections facilities deal with contraband and violence, and staffing shortages have hit prisons around the country in recent months, Gustin, the CoreCivic spokesperson, pointed out. He said Leavenworth has \"made significant capital investments to the facility to improve safety and security,\" including adding a locksmith position, repairing any damaged locks, reducing violent incidents and interdicting more contraband. The company declined to allow a CNN reporter to visit the facility.\\u202f Federal officials overseeing the facility have made clear they\\'re aware of the problems.\\u202f \"The only way I could describe it, frankly, what\\'s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\\'s an absolute hellhole,\" Julie Robinson, the chief judge of the US district court for Kansas, declared during a September sentencing hearing, according to a transcript reviewed by CNN. A staffer for Robinson declined an interview request for her.\\u202f What\\'s next for Leavenworth? With the Leavenworth contract set to expire at the end of December, the Marshals Service is starting to pull detainees out of the jail -- but what comes next is still uncertain. Miller, the US marshal for Kansas, said that most inmates are being relocated to a separate government-run federal prison in Leavenworth. Conditions have improved in the CoreCivic jail as the inmate population has decreased, he said. Still, he said he would have recommended the contract not be renewed even if it weren\\'t for Biden\\'s order. \"CoreCivic was not able to address it,\" Miller said of the violence in the facility. Earlier this year, CoreCivic proposed that the county government take over the facility. The CoreCivic CEO, Damon Hininger -- who grew up nearby and launched his career as a corrections officer at the Leavenworth Detention Center in 1992 -- described the proposal during a meeting of the county commission in April as \"a thoughtful but creative way\" to keep the jail open and comply with Biden\\'s executive order. But the county commission eventually turned down the proposal, worried about lawsuits related to the jail. Since then, \"we\\'ve not had any further contact\" from CoreCivic about the facility\\'s future, said Vicky Kaaz, a commissioner.\\u202f The Leavenworth County Courthouse building, where the county commissioners\\' office is located, in Leavenworth, Kansas.During CoreCivic\\'s quarterly earnings call on November 9, Hininger told investors the company is \"currently in discussions with other potential government partners to utilize the Leavenworth facility,\" adding that conversations are happening at a \"couple of different levels.\" In Leavenworth, rumors are swirling about who that partner could be. Paul Kramer, the Leavenworth city manager, said he had heard that CoreCivic was exploring the possibility of reopening the jail as an ICE detention center. Several guards said that executives at the prison were still assuring employees in recent weeks that the jail would stay open. An ICE spokesperson declined to comment on whether the facility was being considered. Any facility that\\'s transformed from a prison to an immigrant detention center would require major renovations. But in at least one past example, a troubled prison converted to hold immigrants continued to have problems after reopening in its new form.\\u202f \\u200b\\u200bIn 2019, the Bureau of Prisons stopped using the Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi, operated by CoreCivic, after reports of chronic understaffing, lack of medical care, poor conditions and a riot that had killed a guard. A few months after the Bureau of Prisons left, ICE began using the facility to hold detainees. Local ICE officers objected to the use of the Adams County prison as an immigration detention center \"because of that facility\\'s history of chronic understaffing in correctional and health services\" but were overridden by ICE headquarters, according to a report from the US Government Accountability Office. Earlier this year, an inspector general report found \"violations of ICE detention standards that threatened the health, safety, and rights of detainees\" at the facility, including a medical oversight that had led to a detainee death and lax Covid procedures that had resulted in an outbreak. Activists are worried that if Leavenworth does reopen as an immigrant detention center -- or in another form -- the problems plaguing the facility would continue. Federal public defenders and local American Civil Liberties Union chapters urged the Biden administration in a September letter to keep the facility closed. Sharon Brett, the legal director at the ACLU of Kansas and a former Justice Department lawyer who spent years investigating prison conditions for the federal government, said Leavenworth could be appealing to ICE due to its central location in the US, as well as a new Illinois law forcing the agency to stop detaining immigrants in that state.\\u202f \"It\\'s a thousand-bed facility that will be sitting empty in a region that would be ripe for ICE to target,\" Brett said. \"As long as the government is going to continue to rely on detention, there is an opportunity for corporations to profit.\"   (CNN)Brandon Steele, a second-term Republican in West Virginia\\'s House, worked hard this year to get his colleagues to pass his \"Second Amendment Preservation Act.\" It seeks to bar state or local police from enforcing new federal gun restrictions the Biden administration might adopt. Mind you, Steele himself concedes he doesn\\'t see significant new federal restrictions getting passed anytime soon. \"The Biden administration has not gotten anywhere in terms of pushing their firearms regulatory agenda; they haven\\'t even got their ATF guy in there,\" he told CNN. \"There are a lot of forces in play to keep that from happening.\"With a 50-50 US Senate, a paper-thin margin in the House, and Biden focused on other priorities, advocates on both sides acknowledge that sweeping measures to address gun violence appear unlikely.But that hasn\\'t stopped gun-rights groups and politicians across the country from ginning up fears that Biden wants to, as Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz put it, \"erase the Second Amendment,\" and come to people\\'s homes and take away their guns. Read MoreGOP lawmakers in at least 17 states have introduced bills this year taking aim at possible federal gun restrictions, a CNN review has found. Nine of those states signed new laws that take a page from the immigration sanctuary movement (which limited state and local police from helping with federal immigration enforcement), by barring local and state police agencies from helping enforce any new federal gun laws.  And two states, Missouri and Arizona, enacted measures that conflict with existing federal gun laws in ways that prosecutors tell CNN already are making it harder, or risk making it harder, to investigate gun crimes.  The inflammatory rhetoric surrounding these new laws, critics says, is similar and even connected to claims of 2020 election fraud and pushback against Covid-19 vaccine or mask mandates in that they rely on a denial of reality. \"They are part of an ideological system, [and believe] that the other side -- in this case, the Democrats -- are devious and intent on taking political rights away and imposing a socialistic tyranny,\" said Alexandra Filindra, a political science professor at University of Illinois, Chicago, who studies gun politics, disinformation and social media. \"Information that conflicts with this narrative is dismissed,\" she said. \"Saying Biden is a Democrat and coming for your guns is a great way to motivate anger and get people to vote in the midterm, especially.\" Missouri \"suspends participation\"While most of the new gun laws are aimed at some perceived future threat to gun ownership, the ones in Missouri and Arizona, at a minimum, have the potential to undermine present-day law enforcement investigations. Soon after Missouri adopted its \"Second Amendment Preservation Act\" in June, at least a dozen federally deputized state and local law enforcement officers withdrew from joint task forces where they\\'d worked with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate violent gun crimes and illegal gun trafficking, according to Frederic Winston, the head of ATF\\'s Kansas City field office.Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. John Hotz confirmed it \"has suspended participation\" in ATF\\'s joint task force. As a result, Winston said, the patrol stopped submitting firearms-trace requests to ATF, and stopped assisting in referrals to the FBI\\'s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, for investigations of people who get a firearm from a licensed dealer despite being prohibited from doing so. Missouri\\'s act seeks to nullify any federal gun laws that tax guns, ammunition or accessories; that register or track firearms or firearms ownership; or that would confiscate or forbid the ownership, use, or transfer of guns by \"law-abiding citizens.\" It says no state or local officers or officials \"can have authority to enforce or attempt to enforce\" such laws.State lawmakers also adopted an approach used in Texas\\' controversial abortion legislation by letting residents sue, for up to $50,000, local or state police who enforce federal gun laws that fall afoul of the act. US Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), right, speaks during a Second Amendment Rally Sept. 16, 2021, at a gun store in Midland, Texas.Frederic Winston, the head of the ATF\\'s Kansas City field office, said in a court declaration that the act \"deprives law enforcement of information needed to successfully investigate crimes, including violent crimes.\" The city of St. Louis filed a lawsuit seeking to block the law shortly after it was passed. The Department of Justice supported that effort, arguing that under the US \"Constitution\\'s Supremacy Clause, the State of Missouri has no power to nullify federal laws.\" Like Missouri\\'s law, Arizona\\'s \"Second Amendment Sanctuary\" act, signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey in May, applies to current federal firearms laws. It orders state and local police agencies not to enforce or cooperate with any federal measures that are \"inconsistent with any law of this state regarding the regulation of firearms.\" That bar on enforcement is modeled on California\\'s 2017 immigration sanctuary law, state Rep. Leo Biasiucci, its author, told The Washington Monthly. Biasiucci didn\\'t respond to repeated interview requests from CNN.States can\\'t simply claim to nullify federal firearms laws that go farther than state laws, said Jonathan Lowy, chief legal counsel of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. If they think a law is unconstitutional, they can challenge it in court, he said. \"That\\'s the way you do it:  You challenge laws. You don\\'t say, \\'I\\'m not going to follow federal law.\\'\"Unlike in Missouri, federal and state law enforcement officials in Arizona say they haven\\'t seen changes in joint task forces or other collaborations to investigate illegal gun trafficking or violent gun crimes. Arizona\\'s gun law did swiftly draw a backlash from the Tucson City Council, which in June adopted a resolution to continue enforcing federal gun laws.  Tucson, where several churches were early leaders in the 1980s immigration sanctuary movement, and where the 2011 shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and 18 other people in a grocery-store parking lot remains etched into memory, has often clashed with the state\\'s GOP-dominated leadership. \"We fully intend to enforce federal gun laws in Arizona,\" said Tucson City Council Member Steve Kozachik. \"I believe their nullification amendment is highly unconstitutional, and it\\'s not anywhere close to being in the best interests of our constituents to say we\\'re going to opt out of federal gun laws.\"Immigration sanctuary modelLegal experts across the spectrum say that while provisions in Missouri and Arizona\\'s laws appear to go too far, other recent acts, such as West Virginia\\'s \"Second Amendment Preservation and Anti-Federal Commandeering Act,\" are likely to survive legal challenges. Those measures rely on what\\'s known as the \"anti-commandeering\" doctrine, which holds that the federal government can\\'t make state or local authorities enforce federal regulations on its behalf. That doctrine has repeatedly been upheld in recent cases involving immigration-sanctuary laws adopted by dozens of cities, from Seattle and San Francisco to Jackson, Mississippi.  \"It\\'s perfectly constitutional for state officials to opt not to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement or federal gun enforcement,\" said Eric Ruben, an assistant professor of law at Southern Methodist University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy think tank. Some state GOP lawmakers who, under President Donald Trump, passed laws to preempt cities from declaring themselves immigration sanctuaries, initially shied at embracing a sanctuary approach for guns. \"I actually had some members balk at the concept of using the word sanctuary,\" said state Rep. Scotty Campbell, of Mountain City, Tennessee, about his gun-protection bill. \"I argued it was known and understood as a Second Amendment Sanctuary. They didn\\'t want to use the word sanctuary.\"  The new laws seeking to stave off gun restrictions echo gun-advocacy efforts under President Barack Obama that led to seven states adopting similar measures between 2010 and 2016.  Even modest efforts to address gun safety often are painted by opponents as apocalyptic threats. Groups such as Gun Owners of America characterized Biden\\'s recent call to restrict stabilizing gun braces, for example, as \"disarming the American people.\"Last fall, the Trump campaign ran ads in key battleground states that clipped comments Biden made during a CNN interview, taking them out of context to falsely make it sound as though he planned to take away voters\\' guns. Cruz shared a similar false video on social media on the eve of Biden\\'s first joint address to Congress, and claimed that Biden wants to \"erase the Second Amendment.\" In September, Fox News explicitly tied guns and Covid-19 together with a piece titled: \"Second Amendment groups on Biden mandate: If he can force a needle in your arm, can he take your gun?\"  Demonstrators rally outside the US Supreme Court in Washington,  November 3, 2021. The Supreme Court was set to hear arguments in a gun-rights case that centers on  whether limits the state of New York has placed on carrying a gun in public violate the Second Amendment. In interviews with CNN, lawmakers in several states cited such fears as justification for their gun-rights bills.\"We didn\\'t know how far they\\'d go to restrict private gun ownership,\" said Arkansas state Rep. Brandt Smith, for example. \"Confiscation of guns? Restrictions of the purchase of firearms? We wanted to be proactive and prevent that.\" Americans own more guns than ever, and more guns per capita than any other country in the world. Researchers for the Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey estimated that Americans, with 4.3% of the world\\'s population, owned 393 million guns, or 46% of all guns owned by private citizens worldwide, in 2018, the most recent year the survey was conducted. And Americans have bought an estimated 36.9 million more firearms in the past two years, according to Small Arms Analytics, a consulting firm based in South Carolina. Since the US has no national gun registry, gun ownership and sales are estimated by surveys, firearms industry publications, and background checks. These GOP-led efforts to guard against future gun restrictions come at a time when some gun-control measures enjoy broad support. More than 80 percent of people in the US (including 70 percent of Republicans) said they support expanded background checks for guns, in an April 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center. The survey said about half of Americans see gun violence as a major problem in the US -- understandable, given that, according to the Gun Violence Archive, 37,820 people have been shot to death in the US this year through Nov. 4, including 20,328 suicides. But it\\'s the fear of losing guns that animates the call to bar such measures. State Sen. Joey Hensley, who cosponsored a Second Amendment sanctuary bill in Tennessee, said his constituents \"were very concerned about the federal government making more restrictions\" on guns.  \"I\\'m personally not afraid so much of the federal government. I think we have plenty of protections under the Second Amendment and I think the Supreme Court would protect our rights,\" said Hensley. \"But we wanted to get some legislation on the books, so people knew where we stood.\" Filindra, the political scientist, said that the gun-rights narrative has been shifting, from a focus on using guns for self or home protection, to \"the idea that citizens have a right to arms as a check on government, and that without that, the franchise is insecure ... if the voting box is insufficient to guarantee our rights, we have the ammo box.\" In this narrative, she said, \"threats to gun rights are existential threats to democracy.\" Whether or not Congress actually can pass a substantial gun-control measure is beside the point, said Sarah Byner, research director for Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics and its effect on public policies and elections. \"That\\'s something about the political climate we\\'re in. Even if it\\'s out of the realm of anything being discussed in the Congress, people aren\\'t following Congress; people aren\\'t police experts. They respond to the messages and that\\'s what these groups are putting out into the world, facts be damned,\" she said.     This story contains disturbing language. (CNN)When the election office led by Lisa Deeley first came under attack from then-President Donald Trump last year, it was more than a month before Election Day.Deeley, the chair of Philadelphia\\'s three-member election commission and a Democrat, watched from home as Trump falsely claimed during the first 2020 presidential debate that poll watchers had already been turned away at early voting centers in Philadelphia.\"Bad things happen in Philadelphia,\" Trump said. Deeley\\'s cell phone immediately lit up with calls and text messages.\"A lot of my family, my friends, got a little chuckle out of it, but I knew it wasn\\'t at all something to laugh about,\" she told CNN. \"It was just the beginning.\"Read MoreLisa Deeley, chair of Philadelphia\\'s election commission, speaks at a news conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 4, 2020. Trump\\'s efforts to subvert the election began well before Election Day, and have only gained momentum since, with Republicans passing laws to restrict voting or make it easier for partisans to interfere in more than a dozen states, including key battlegrounds. Most recently, in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott signed an election bill into law last week over the fierce objection of the state\\'s Democrats, who, in hopes of derailing similar restrictions proposed earlier this summer, had fled the state two times en masse.The state legislative efforts are bolstered by a coordinated, behind-the-scenes push by conservative groups to raise millions to support restrictive voting laws, spread unproven claims about voter fraud and fund sham audits of election results. All of which, election experts say, will make it easier the next time to overturn close results, and puts the future of free and fair elections in jeopardy.\"I don\\'t think we\\'ve ever been at a point that\\'s been quite this tenuous for the democracy,\" Christine Todd Whitman, a former GOP governor of New Jersey and a founder and co-chair of States United Democracy Center, told CNN. \"I think it\\'s a huge danger because it\\'s the first time that I\\'ve seen it being undermined -- our democracy being undermined from within.\" CNN spoke to about a dozen state and county officials involved in elections for this story; all of them expressed concern that the widespread and unsubstantiated claims of a stolen election could take a lasting toll on American democracy. For weeks after the election, Trump tried to sabotage the will of American voters in his relentless attempts to overturn the results. He and his allies browbeat local officials in multiple states and tried in vain to coerce the Department of Justice to open a bogus investigation. They dispatched attorneys to file nearly 60 lawsuits across the country; all but one minor case were dropped or dismissed -- some by Trump-appointed judges.But while those efforts were stymied by a thin line of civil servants, a concerted push in myriad states to set the stage for a future power grab is finding more success. \"It\\'s all designed to make it easier to raise the doubt and uncertainty to allow a close election to be overturned,\" said Ben Berwick, an attorney at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that works to keep elections and election administration from being politicized.  \"2020 was a preview of what is likely to be darker times to come, if we continue down this path away from democracy.\" Big lie fuels threats against election workersPolls show most Republican voters continue to believe Trump\\'s lie that he won the election. In July, a poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that two-thirds of Republicans still believe Biden was not legitimately elected.That big lie, coupled with punishing new laws and threats against poll workers, has prompted fatigue in the field and a potential exodus of knowledgeable people to run smooth elections in the future, experts and poll workers say.\"What it\\'s going to cause -- and we\\'ve seen this happening across the country -- is local officials are going to leave,\" said Matthew Masterson, a former senior cybersecurity adviser with the Department of Homeland Security\\'s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, primarily responsible for elections. \"That opens the door to adding more political actors -- less professional, more political actors -- into the election space, which, again, is incredibly dangerous.\" Matthew Masterson testifies on election security before the House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, on October 22, 2019.Nearly 1 in 3 election officials say they feel unsafe because of their jobs, and about 1 in 5 listed threats to their lives as a job-related concern, according to a spring survey commissioned by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\\'s Law School. Among them is Claire Woodall-Vogg, the executive director of the Milwaukee election commission. In early August -- nine months after the election -- she received voicemails calling for her hanging. Those and other threats followed two rightwing websites publishing an email exchange in which she responded to a joke by an election consultant on November 4 about how the votes had been submitted at 3 a.m. The sites suggested Woodall-Vogg delivered Joe Biden a questionable win in her district.\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of the calls Woodall-Vogg has received.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are we going to hold people who are publishing conspiracy theories accountable when someone does get killed?\" Woodall-Vogg said in an interview with CNN.  In Philadelphia, Deeley was confronted outside the convention center a few days after the election by a man taking a cellphone video of her walking down the street. It was James Fitzpatrick, Trump\\'s Pennsylvania director of Election Day operations, who lobbed allegations of corruption at her as she covered her face.\"It got millions of views,\" Deeley, an elected official, told CNN. \"And awful comments about my physical shape, people called me all kinds of names, people saying I should be hung for treason, that \\'we should find out where she lives and kill her,\\' \\'we should bludgeon her.\\' I mean -- unbelievable.\" The city was also flooded with threatening phone calls. \\n\\n\\nHere are some of the threats called into Deeley\\'s office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"People just wanted to believe,\" Deeley said. \"They want to believe something that is not true. And there\\'s not one shred of evidence to prove that it\\'s true, but they just want to believe it.\"It isn\\'t just election officials who have faced threats. In Arizona, which in last year\\'s presidential vote flipped from red to blue, a wave of animus came down on the majority-Republican Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, which oversees elections for about 60% of the state\\'s voters. \"On a daily basis ... we\\'re told that we need to go in, go to jail -- either on social media, phone calls to the office, emails -- and the threats do continue,\" said Bill Gates, a Republican member of the board, adding that last month, \"My colleagues and I all were treated to an orange jumpsuit that a gentleman sent to us and, you know, declared that we will end up in jail someday because we are traitors in the minds of these people.\"Pressure campaign results in coup attemptJust as he did in 2016, when he claimed the upcoming election was \"rigged\" against him, Trump started calling the integrity of the 2020 election into question long before any vote was cast. \"The only way we\\'re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged,\" he told a group of supporters in Wisconsin last August.After the election, as the days ticked by, Trump\\'s increasingly desperate behavior produced a steady barrage of headlines -- as it always has. From his perch at the White House, a symbol of the strongest democracy in human history, he made personal phone calls to local officials, badgering them to change the results. He paid considerable attention to Georgia, another state that flipped from red to blue in November.Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\\'s secretary of state, speaks during a news conference at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta on December 14, 2020. In a particularly stunning exchange, Trump tried to convince Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to change the vote count -- a move that became part of a criminal state investigation into attempts to \"influence the election.\"During that call, Trump said he wanted to \"find 11,780 votes\" -- the amount he needed to win Georgia by a single vote.\\n\\n\\nListen to part of Trump\\'s call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump\\'s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, also made the rounds. He phoned Gates, the Republican member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in Arizona. \\n\\n\\nListen to Giuliani\\'s voicemail to a member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in Arizona.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGates did not return the call. \"This was the first time that I was ever aware of that you had folks at the national level trying to impose their will on a county elected official,\" Gates told CNN. \"That was bizarre and frightening.\"Trump also convened multiple meetings with elected officials from purple states at the White House to discuss election fraud, even though his own Department of Homeland Security declared the election \"the most secure in American history.\" And on January 6 in Washington -- the day Vice President Mike Pence disregarded Trump\\'s request to challenge the results -- Trump told tens of thousands of supporters who\\'d convened in DC that day to \"fight like hell.\" A deadly riot ensued shortly after at the US Capitol. \\n\\n\\n\\nInteractive: Assault on Democracy: Paths to Insurrection\\n\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t until this summer, when a series of revelations surfaced about how Trump had sought to use his Department of Justice as a cudgel to turn a loss into a win, that it became clear what the totality of his actions amounted to: an attempted coup. In late July, the Department of Justice released documents showing that Trump in December had threatened to replace his acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, with a midlevel attorney in the Justice Department named Jeffrey Clark, who\\'d been meeting with Trump and promoted wild conspiracy theories about election fraud -- such as that a Dominion voting machine had \"accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China.\" Clark also urged his superiors -- Rosen and his deputy, Richard Donoghue --  to sign a letter to Georgia\\'s governor falsely claiming the Department of Justice had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.\"None of that worked to keep Trump in office. But the extraordinary events of the past year raise the question: Was the chaotic campaign to circumvent the will of American voters unique to Trump? Or has a new standard been set? \"Trump-ism is going to survive Donald Trump, and he has unleashed a set of forces, anti-democratic -- small-D democratic -- anti-democratic forces that are going to plague American democracy for years to come,\" warned Rick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California at Irvine. \"I think we\\'re in grave danger.\"New laws shift election powersFive days before the November election, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp\\'s office announced that he and his wife were in quarantine after having been in contact with someone who\\'d tested positive for Covid-19. That day, Kemp requested an absentee ballot, which arrived a day before the election.Four months later, in March, Kemp signed a voting bill into law that, had it been in place for the 2020 election, would have barred even himself from receiving a ballot, said Tonnie Adams, a self-described conservative who serves as elections supervisor for Georgia\\'s Heard County. \"I\\'m not kidding,\" Adams told CNN. \"Gov. Kemp would not have been able to vote if this rule had been in place.\"Gov. Brian Kemp signs Georgia\\'s Election Integrity Act on March 25, 2021.Under Georgia\\'s Election Integrity Act of 2021, voters are not permitted to apply for an absentee ballot within 11 days before the election -- which would have invalidated Kemp. In addition to making absentee voting -- or \"mail-in voting\" -- harder in this and other ways, the new law reduces drop boxes, essentially bans mobile voting centers, makes it illegal for election officials to mail out unsolicited absentee-ballot applications to all voters, and also makes it illegal for people to offer food or water to voters in line within a certain radius of the voting precinct.Georgia\\'s law is just one of a slew to be proposed or enacted in the noisy aftermath of the election, all hurriedly conceived at a time of rampant amplification of Trump\\'s lie. The Justice Department is suing the state over its new voting restrictions.In more than a dozen states -- including toss-ups like Georgia, Arizona and Florida -- Republican-led legislatures are enacting laws that could make it more difficult to vote. The restrictions are expected to disproportionately impact a rapidly growing demographic -- non-White voters --  to the benefit of a shrinking Republican base. Voter-outreach groups say the batch of new statutes represents the most serious threat to the voting power of the marginalized since Jim Crow-era poll taxes and literacy tests, which sought to curtail the Black vote and were banished by the 24th Amendment and federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. Aklima Khondoker, chief legal officer of the New Georgia Project -- a nonpartisan voter registration group founded by Stacey Abrams -- said the surge of new laws is \"shocking, but not surprising.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nInteractive: Black voting rights and voter suppression: A timeline\\n\\n\\n\"I was shocked because it is appalling to see this out-and-out lie proliferate the way that it has over our elections,\" she said. \"It\\'s not surprising, because when you look at the history of voting -- not only in Georgia but across our nation -- it has always been fraught. It has always come up against challenges to people of color specifically.\" Georgia\\'s new law, experts say, is the boldest of the bunch.\"It\\'s a massive power grab,\" said Adams.To be sure, there are some provisions of the 98-page Georgia law that actually expand voting access, such as weekend hours during the early voting period. But Georgia\\'s law and others passed in 2021 are calling for a new kind of tactic that experts find alarming, in which elections are increasingly overseen by partisan officials. Hasen, the elections expert at UC Irvine, calls it \"election subversion,\" a phenomenon that he says is distinct from \"voter suppression\" and is \"newly appearing on the horizon.\" \"The idea here is manipulating how votes are counted or how elections are conducted, so that it\\'s possible that the winner who was announced is not actually the choice of the voters,\" Hasen said.Georgia\\'s law takes what had been the secretary of state\\'s seat on the state elections board and hands it to a legislative appointee, granting the GOP-controlled legislature more power over the board. It then allows that board to suspend county election officials and replace them with an individual of its choosing. The law effectively empowers partisan state lawmakers to intervene in how counties administer and count the vote -- a process that has already begun in Fulton County, the state\\'s most populous, predominantly blue county that\\'s faced complaints over its election operations for years.In Arizona, a new law includes a remarkable end run around Democrats.  In recent months, Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law GOP measures that, along with enacting voting restrictions and making it easier to purge early voting lists, stripped power from the secretary of state, Democrat Katie Hobbs. It shifts control over any election-related litigation to Arizona\\'s attorney general, currently Republican Mark Brnovich, but only until January 2023, when Hobbs\\' term ends -- in effect, ensuring that a Republican official will control any litigation over mid-term elections in that state.\"That\\'s pretty blatant,\" said Lawrence\\u202fNorden, director of the Brennan Center\\'s Election Reform Program.Hobbs told CNN it\\'s all part of a larger coordinated effort.\"We\\'re seeing a shift to highly partisan individuals wanting to put these powers in the hands of other highly partisan individuals,\" she said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott shows off Senate Bill 1, also known as the election integrity bill, after he signed it into law on Sept. 7, 2021.Most recently, in Texas, a months-long drama over a voting bill came to a head last week when Gov. Abbott signed a measure that will tighten restrictions on mail-in voting, reduce hours for drive-thru voting, criminalize the act of sending mail-in voting applications to people who haven\\'t requested them, and grant more powers to partisan poll watchers. Democratic state lawmakers went to extremes to block passage, saying the effort is aimed at curtailing the minority vote in urban centers. In May, more than 50 of them decamped from the state Capitol, derailing a similar bill. They repeated the move in July, prompting the state House speaker to sign warrants for their civil arrest.\"There\\'s a lot of seats last election cycle won by a few hundred votes,\" state Rep. Gene Wu, a Democrat, told CNN. \"That\\'s the whole point. Because they know they don\\'t need to put something in law that says Black people can\\'t vote. They just need for point five percent of Black people not to be able to vote.\"All told, experts and activists say, many of the new election laws share the quality of having been put forth as the solution to a nonexistent problem -- widespread voter fraud -- manufactured by Trump and the GOP. For instance, in Florida, even Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis boasted in November about how smoothly the 2020 election went in the Sunshine State, which Trump won. And yet, in May, DeSantis signed into law a bill that restricts voting, saying it would \"increase transparency and strengthen the security of our elections.\"\"We\\'d already had a couple of weeks of just total chest-thumping -- we\\'re great, did well, yay, Florida\\'s not a laughingstock anymore,\" said Cecile Scoon, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, which is suing the state for its new law. \"So to then be quote \\'rewarded\\' ... with these limitations and restrictions that are likely to have a disparate impact on minorities and the youth and the disabled, is very concerning.\" After Kemp signed the new voter law in Georgia, he made a point of sounding off on his political foes, chief among them President Joe Biden, who had employed some hyperbole of his own when he called the new law \"Jim Crow on steroids.\"\"President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box,\" Kemp said. After the election, three separate audits were conducted in Georgia; none found evidence of widespread fraud.\\'Working off the same playbook\\'Less than a week before the Georgia legislature passed its controversial election bill, a former Trump administration official named Jessica Anderson met with Kemp. In a leaked video published by the watchdog group Documented and Mother Jones magazine, Anderson -- now the executive director of Heritage Action for America, an affiliate of the enormously influential conservative Heritage Foundation -- told the audience of donors what she told Kemp. \"I had one message for him: Do not wait to sign that bill,\" she said she had told him. \"If you wait even an hour, you will look weak.\"\\n\\n\\nListen to Anderson describe her conversation with Georgia\\'s governor.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the video, Anderson claimed that Heritage had recommended eight key provisions in the bill that Kemp signed, and that Heritage has done the same for other states.\"In some cases, we actually draft them for them, or we have a sentinel on our behalf give them the model legislation so it has that grassroots, from-the-bottom-up type of vibe,\" she said at the closed-door retreat in April. Kemp\\'s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Behind the scenes, the efforts to limit voting rights in statehouses around the country are being organized and encouraged by deep-pocketed conservative groups raising the specter of voting fraud. The Heritage Foundation published a list of \"best practices\" for voting laws earlier this year that includes limiting absentee voting, banning same-day and automatic voter registration, and making it easier for state legislatures to sue other state officials over election rules. Many of the bills passed by legislators in recent months made those same changes. \"They are all working off the same playbook,\" said Berwick, the attorney with Protect Democracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\nHeritage Action -- which has received donations from trade groups for the petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, among other groups -- has also worked more directly with lawmakers. Back in April, in addition to taking credit for much of Georgia\\'s bill, Anderson of Heritage Action told the donors her group had also helped push similar bills in Arizona and Iowa. (Iowa lawmakers have denied working with the group on their voting legislation, and a state ethics investigation found no evidence that Heritage lobbied state officials and lawmakers.)And Heritage lobbyists and activists also worked with GOP legislators in Florida to shape their new restrictive voting law. In a statement to CNN that echoed arguments made by Republican legislators around the country, Anderson said Heritage was \"proud of our grassroots members\\' work to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\"\"Members of the press using their platforms to spin up paranoia and resentment instead of covering problems with our election systems and focusing on real efforts to secure our elections are doing a disservice to their audiences,\" she said.Other conservative groups have also worked to challenge voting laws in the courts, sued states and counties to encourage more frequent purges of voter rolls, and recruited poll watchers to challenge voters\\' eligibility. And many of the organizations are funded by the same big donors and deep-pocketed foundations, such as the Milwaukee-based Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, which has given millions of dollars to groups that have advocated for more restrictive voting laws or pushed unproven claims about voting fraud, according to tax records. The efforts by Trump to overturn the election result and conservatives to rewrite voting rules are deeply linked. The Bradley Foundation\\'s board includes Cleta Mitchell, a conservative lawyer who joined Trump on his call to Georgia election officials in which the president asked them to \"find\" thousands of votes for him. Documents from the group posted by hackers in 2016 (and later obtained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) show that the foundation shifted over the last decade from a focus on Wisconsin issues to funding national conservative groups and think tanks, a change encouraged by Mitchell. Cleta Mitchell speaks during an event marking the 100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment ratification with President Donald Trump, left, in the Blue Room of the White House on August 18, 2020.In a statement to CNN, Bradley spokesperson Christine Czernejewski said the foundation \"has supported efforts that encourage voter participation and give Americans the confidence that their vote matters,\" adding that in light of pandemic-related changes to voting in 2020, \"it is reasonable and prudent to assess last year\\'s elections and then determine how to improve the system.\" Czernejewski did not make Mitchell available for an interview. Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state, said it was clear that conservatives trying to restrict voting rights were working together -- including in right-wing efforts to \"audit\" the 2020 election results. A company running a particularly controversial right-wing ballot inspection in Arizona has received millions of dollars from groups led by Trump allies, including Sidney Powell, one of the lawyers who filed Trump\\'s cases to overturn the election results, and Michael Flynn, Trump\\'s former national security adviser. \"There\\'s been really what seems to be a coordinated approach on multiple scores, introducing bills to make it harder to vote, bills that change who oversees certain aspects of elections -- and then continuing this fake audit that will undermine reality,\" Hobbs said. Sham audits are keeping the big lie aliveThe Arizona audit began with a three-page subpoena to the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors containing a typo that, under normal circumstances, wouldn\\'t raise an eyebrow. In the subpoena, a GOP state legislator in Arizona demanded a list of items and data, including the \"ballet cancel date.\" The word should have been \"ballot.\" The election materials seized from the subpoena were handed over to Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based cybersecurity company whose CEO, Doug Logan, has declared his support for Trump and repeatedly spread misinformation on social media insinuating that Biden stole the election. (Some of the misinformation shared by Logan has come in the form of retweeted false claims of fraud by Powell, Flynn and Ron Watkins, a heavy promoter of QAnon conspiracy theories. Logan has since deleted his Twitter account.) Contractors working for Cyber Ninjas, which was hired by the Arizona State Senate, examine and recount ballots from the 2020 general election on May 3, 2021 in Phoenix, Arizona. Since Cyber Ninjas\\' controversial examination began in April, two other Trump-backing state legislators -- one in Wisconsin, one in Pennsylvania -- have sent their own demands to election officials in their states. Both contained much of the same boilerplate language, right down to the ballet/ballot typo. (In all three states, the results of the November election have already been confirmed in official audits by experts.)The Wisconsin letter also seemed to crib language from the Pennsylvania one. Like the Pennsylvania letter, the subpoena from Republican state Rep. Janel Brandtjen demands access to data from a specific voting machine model made by Election Systems & Software, even though that model isn\\'t used in Wisconsin. It also seeks training material for \"Judges of Elections.\" Pennsylvania has election judges; Wisconsin does not.The copy-and-pasting gaffes are another illustration of the coordination among Trumpian Republicans nationwide in their efforts to keep the narrative of a stolen election alive. \"Attacks on voter rights are not new, but this coordination is,\" said Hobbs, Arizona\\'s secretary of state. The Arizona review\\'s stack of well-documented problems is tall: a contractor inexperienced in election audits; millions in partisan funding from \"Stop the Steal\" advocates; procedures made public only after court battles; counting and review processes that changed midstream; internal fights that led the auditors to lock out the state Senate\\'s own liaison for a time.\"This process isn\\'t an audit or review, but instead a grift,\" said Masterson, the former Department of Homeland Security cybersecurity adviser. \"This is an effort and a playbook that, unfortunately, we\\'ll see again, because it has proven to be effective both in the messaging and in the fundraising around it.\"In Wisconsin, Brandtjen\\'s subpoenas don\\'t appear to carry any legal weight. A recent memo from Wisconsin\\'s Legislative Council noted that, under state law, legislative subpoenas must be signed by the assembly\\'s speaker and chief clerk, which Brandtjen\\'s subpoenas are not. A separate review, ordered by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, is being led by a former state supreme court justice who last year told a pro-Trump rally that a stolen election would be \"systematically unjust.\"In Pennsylvania, state Sen. Doug Mastriano\\'s threat to subpoena several counties for election materials unraveled last month when he announced that his plan to bring the matter to a vote on the GOP-dominated committee that he chairs had been blocked. But state Republicans launched an election review this week, an effort led by state Sen. Cris Dush, who visited Arizona\\'s audit this spring and said he \"absolutely\" wants to replicate the process there.Taken together, the pseudo audits, the widespread claims of a stolen election despite a lack of credible evidence, the hounding of election officials by the White House, Trump\\'s attempts to turn the Department of Justice into a weapon against a fair outcome, the threats of bodily harm to people in charge of counting the votes, the wave of new laws that restrict voting in response to false claims of election fraud and could put more partisans in charge of elections -- and all of it increasingly underwritten by the full force of a mighty political machine -- add up to a warning: Americans on the losing end of elections may become less and less willing to accept the results. In short, as the nation\\'s culture and demographics shift, one of the two major political parties in the world\\'s beacon of democracy has a huge faction that favors contracting the vote over expanding the party tent. \"It used to be unthinkable to contemplate election subversion in the United States,\" Hasen said. \"It\\'s now not only become thinkable, but become something that we need to spend the next few years guarding against. It is the greatest danger facing American democracy today.\"  CNN\\'s Drew Griffin, Curt Devine, Scott Bronstein, Yahya Abou-Ghazala and Audrey Ash contributed to this story.  (CNN)A Texas woman told police in 2002 that Georgia US Senate candidate Herschel Walker had threatened and stalked her, according to a police report obtained by CNN.  The woman, a friend of Walker\\'s ex-wife, told police that the football star had been following her, and had previously made \"threats to her\" and had \"her house watched.\" The report did not specify the nature of the threats by Walker, who is now one of the highest-profile Senate candidates in the country and a close ally of former president Donald Trump, who endorsed him on Thursday.   Over the years, two other women -- Walker\\'s ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend -- have also accused him of making threats, telling authorities Walker claimed he would shoot them in the head. Their years-old accounts have resurfaced in recent weeks as Walker, who won national fame as a college football player at the University of Georgia, launched a campaign for the Peach State\\'s battleground Senate seat. The third woman\\'s account has not been previously reported.  President Donald Trump is greeted by Herschel Walker at an event in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 25, 2020.The woman, who was in her late 20s at the time she contacted police, confirmed to CNN this week that Walker had threatened her, but asked not to be identified and declined to discuss the specifics of his threats. She stressed that she never dated or had a relationship with Walker. Walker\\'s campaign declined to respond to the woman\\'s allegations or discuss the 2002 police report. In response to questions about the incident, Mallory Blount, a campaign spokesperson, cited Walker\\'s past struggles with mental health issues, which he\\'s spoken about publicly. Read More\"It is sad that many in politics and the media who praised Herschel for his transparency over a decade ago are now making false statements, stereotyping, attacking, and attempting to sensationalize his past just because he is a Republican Senate candidate,\" she said in a statement. Reports detail claims against WalkerIn the May 2002 report, which CNN obtained through a public records request, a police officer from the Dallas suburb of Irving wrote that he responded to a \"prowler call\" from a woman who said she believed someone was \"sneaking around outside her house.\" The woman said she \"felt she knew who the person would be\" but was \"very reluctant to tell me,\" the officer, Jason Mullins, wrote in the report.  Eventually, the woman told Mullins that the person she suspected was Walker. About a year before calling the police, the woman told Mullins, she had had \"a confrontation\" with Walker and \"he began calling her, making threats to her and having her house watched.\" It\\'s not clear from the document what those threats entailed.  She said that when she had recently seen Walker at a local resort, the former football star \"jumped into\" his vehicle and followed her \"all the way to her house,\" according to the report.

Mullins, who is still working for the Irving police department, said that from what he could tell, the department didn\\'t further investigate the woman\\'s allegations.  \"Since she stated that she didn\\'t want us to contact him, it\\'s unlikely that we would have, but I can\\'t tell you that for sure,\" Mullins told CNN. He said the woman\\'s allegation appeared to have been taken as an \"informational report\" that would stay on file, instead of a \"criminal offense report\" that would be forwarded to police investigators. The report came around the same time that Walker\\'s wife, Cindy Grossman, was divorcing him after nearly two decades of marriage. Grossman has spoken publicly about Walker threatening to kill her during their marriage. In a 2008 interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, she said that Walker had held a razor to her throat, and at one point, \"he held [a] gun to my temple and said he was going to blow my brains out.\" Grossman did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment this week. The threats continued after the couple was separated. In December 2005, Grossman filed for a protective order against Walker. Grossman\\'s sister, Maria Tsettos, said in an affidavit submitted with the request that Walker had called her and threatened to kill Grossman and her then-boyfriend. He \"stated unequivocally that he was going to shoot my sister Cindy and her boyfriend in the head,\" Tsettos said.   One day that month, Grossman and her boyfriend were at a mall when Walker \"slowly drove by in his vehicle, pointed his finger at (Grossman) and tracked (her) with his finger as he drove,\" according to the petition. Walker had called Tsettos threatening Grossman again earlier that day. The judge granted the petition for a protective order. The Associated Press first reported the case. Walker\\'s book details mental health issuesWalker has spoken publicly about facing mental health issues during his marriage to Grossman, saying in interviews and writing in a book that he had been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, which was previously known as multiple personality disorder. He said in the 2008 CNN interview that he didn\\'t remember being violent toward his wife, but he didn\\'t deny it and noted that one of the symptoms of his disorder was blackouts. In his book, Walker wrote that he sought help for his disorder after another violent episode in 2001, in which he drove around the Dallas area looking for a man who had failed to deliver a car he bought. Walker wrote that voices in his head told him to kill the man, and he imagined \"the visceral enjoyment I\\'d get from seeing the small entry would and the spray of brain tissue and blood — like a Fourth of July firework — exploding behind him.\" He fought off the urges and went to a doctor, he said, and later wrote his book to destigmatize mental illness.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother woman romantically involved with Walker later made similar accusations to Grossman\\'s. Myka Dean, who told police she had an on-and-off relationship with Walker for 20 years, said he had threatened to kill her, according to a 2012 Irving police report.  A police officer wrote that Dean said Walker \"told her that he was going to come and sit outside her apartment and \\'blow her head off when she came outside,\\'\" the report said. \"He then told [Dean] he was going to \\'blow his head off\\' after he killed her.\" Dean expressed doubts about reporting the threat, the officer wrote, saying she didn\\'t \"want him to get in trouble\" and becoming \"pretty reserved.\"  The officer noted that the department had had \"previous contact\" with Walker, citing another police report from 2001. The Irving police department declined to publicly release that report this week, saying it was being withheld \"pending an Attorney General request for opinion.\"  The allegation by Dean, who died in 2019, was first reported last week by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.   When asked about Dean\\'s statement to police, Walker\\'s spokesperson Blount said the candidate \"emphatically denies these false claims,\" calling them an example of \"political mudslinging.\" Dean\\'s mother told the Journal-Constitution that she hadn\\'t known about the allegations and added that \"we are very proud of the man Herschel Walker has become.\" CNN\\'s Drew Griffin, Nelli Black, Audrey Ash and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report.  (CNN)Since the presidential election, Christina Jensen says she\\'s been stopped on the street several times by acquaintances who wanted to share troubling news: hackers from Beijing had switched nearly 24,000 votes for Donald Trump in their rural, GOP-leaning Wisconsin county. Jensen, the Clark County clerk and a Republican herself, has patiently explained that the local election computer system isn\\'t connected to the internet -- and the county has less than 17,000 registered voters overall.  But she finds herself unable to convince those constituents of the simple fact that the election wasn\\'t stolen: \"They are like, \\'Well, Mike Lindell says this,\\'\" Jensen said. Lindell, the MyPillow CEO and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, has emerged as one of the most vocal boosters still pushing false claims about the 2020 election. In a series of so-called documentaries, Lindell has advanced an increasingly outlandish theory that foreign hackers broke into the computer systems of election offices like Clark County to switch votes -- in what he has described as the \"biggest cyber-crime in world history.\"  My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a briefing in the Rose Garden of the White House on March 30, 2020.Election officials at more than a dozen counties that Lindell has claimed were hacking targets told CNN that the pillow magnate\\'s claims are utterly meritless. They noted that their voting machines are not connected to the internet, that the results are confirmed by paper ballots, and in some cases that official audits, recounts, or reviews have verified their vote tallies.  Read MoreIn addition, CNN interviewed nine cybersecurity experts, all of whom said the \"proof\" Lindell has released so far is nonsense -- and that there is zero evidence of any kind of successful hacking of last year\\'s election results. But many Americans are buying into baseless claims of vote fraud: polls have found that roughly two-thirds of Republicans believe President Joe Biden was not legitimately elected. And while Lindell isn\\'t as prominent as other right-wing figures denying the election results -- including the former President himself -- his rhetoric has broken through among some of the Trump faithful. Jensen said she watched Lindell\\'s video \"Absolute Proof\" -- which claims that 23,909 votes for Trump had been switched in her county -- after a concerned voter emailed her a link to it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It made me angry,\" she said. \"He has created a lot of doubt in a lot of peoples\\' minds, even though the count was accurate.\" Trump won the county with a margin of more than 5,000 votes.  Lindell -- who once considered running for Minnesota governor or other elected office -- has become persona non grata in mainstream conservative circles. He\\'s been booted from Twitter for violating its policy on sharing election fraud claims, and his videos have been swiftly removed from YouTube and other platforms. His pillows have been taken off the shelves at retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl\\'s. And he and his company are facing a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit from the voting machine company Dominion, which Lindell has falsely accused of being involved in voter fraud.   Now, Lindell is resorting to a last-ditch attempt to promote his theory, planning a \"cyber symposium\" this month in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where he says he will release 37 terabytes of data showing election hacking.   JUST WATCHEDDominion spokesman: Mike Lindell is begging to be suedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDominion spokesman: Mike Lindell is begging to be sued 04:29In a rambling and combative interview with CNN, Lindell insisted that he had proof the election was stolen.  \"I\\'m not wrong. I\\'ve checked it out. I\\'ve spent millions,\" he claimed. \"You need to trust me and come there.\" Election officials say Lindell\\'s conspiracies are undermining faith in the voting system. Scott McDonell, the clerk for Dane County, Wisconsin -- another county where Lindell has claimed hacking switched thousands of votes from Trump to Biden -- said that out of all the election theories he\\'s heard, Lindell\\'s is \"the worst one because it\\'s the dumbest.\" The county conducted a hand recount of every ballot, paid for by Trump\\'s campaign, which verified Biden\\'s win. And every ballot in the state has a paper trail.   \"It\\'s damaging to our democracy,\" McDonell said of Lindell\\'s claims. \"Spurious allegations spread on the internet because they affirm what you want to believe.\" From pillows to conspiracies  President Donald Trump speaks alongside MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, during a \"Made in America\" event with US manufacturers at the White House on July 19, 2017. Since Trump\\'s loss last fall, Lindell has been a superspreader of election misinformation.  A Minnesotan who often talks about his journey from recovered crack cocaine addict to CEO, Lindell made a name for himself with cheery infomercials showing him hugging his trademark pillow. He fell into Trump\\'s orbit during the 2016 election, attending his election night watch party and later showing up at White House events.  Even as many Republican politicians acknowledged Biden\\'s victory, Lindell stuck with Trump\\'s lies about his loss. Lindell has shared a wide range of theories of why the election was stolen, from ballots cast by dead voters to Biden votes being counted multiple times -- all of which have been debunked.  His latest and most operatic theory involves a sweeping conspiracy in which hackers from China and other foreign countries broke into elections office computer systems around the country to reduce the number of votes for Trump. The claim is supported, he says, by \"heroes\" who supposedly captured data proving the hacking and then leaked it to Lindell in January.  Donald Trump\\'s political organization builds war chest topping $100 millionLindell included a snippet of the data in one of his videos and sent CNN a half-dozen additional screenshots he said were examples of the data. He said he has spent millions of dollars to verify the data by hiring unnamed experts -- some of whom he has included, with their faces blurred out and voices changed, in his videos.  But Lindell\\'s claims don\\'t hold water. The first block of data from Lindell\\'s \"Absolutely 9-0\" video, released in June, was a dramatic scrolling video of a long series of numbers in hexadecimal format, a numeric system used by some programmers. When the data is converted to text, it becomes clear that it is not evidence of hacking but a version of Pennsylvania\\'s voter file, listing every voter registered in the state -- a copy of which can be purchased from the state government for $20. The Washington Post first reported the voter file connection. In the video, one of Lindell\\'s anonymous experts says that the data he was showing was \"raw, encrypted data\" proving election hacking. But Lindell later claimed that the data was simply \"B-roll,\" a placeholder for the actual evidence. The other snippets of data Lindell sent to CNN -- which he says are the real deal -- are also far from proof, according to nine cybersecurity experts who reviewed them. The screenshots are other blocks of hexadecimal numbers. When converted to text, they appear to be a list of IP addresses and coordinates, but nothing proving hacking or even the nature of any traffic between them.  JUST WATCHEDJimmy Kimmel is worried about MyPillow\\'s Mike LindellReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJimmy Kimmel is worried about MyPillow\\'s Mike Lindell 02:54In his videos, Lindell has called his data \"PCAPs,\" or packet captures -- a technical format for capturing web traffic. But the experts CNN consulted agreed that the data he has released so far are not PCAPs. Some of the IP addresses listed appear to be associated with public county and city websites -- but not computers involved in vote casting, tallying or other critical election infrastructure, the experts said.  \"These are not PCAP files,\" said Harri Hursti, a computer programmer who organizes voting machine hacking tests and has assisted with election audits. Lindell \"has shown no evidence that he has PCAP files and he has shown no evidence that these files have anything to do with elections,\" he said. J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan and expert in voting machines, called Lindell\\'s antics \"completely ridiculous.\"   \"When security experts produce evidence, we don\\'t send around video of hex-encoded files -- that\\'s entirely Hollywood,\" he said. \"What we do is share the original data (along with information to support its provenance and authenticity) and explain our interpretation so that other experts can verify or dispute it.\" Lindell claims that he will release his full dataset showing election hacking at his so-called symposium. \"Nobody has seen what I have,\" he said. \"No judge, nobody, until I sent you guys a piece of it.\"  But notably, experts said the vast majority of votes in the US -- including in battleground states -- are cast by paper ballot or supported by a paper trail. That means that if hacking did occur, it could be proven by looking back at the ballots. And recounts or audits in several of the counties Lindell says were hacked have verified the results based on those paper ballots.  \"The ballots are ink on dead trees,\" said Dan Wallach, a Rice University computer science professor who has researched electronic voting system security. \"Nothing that happens in China can change the ink on those dead trees.\" The \\'election that never ends\\' MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell waits outside the West Wing of the White House before entering on January 15, 2021.Numerous election officials in the counties that Lindell has identified as purported targets for hacking told CNN they were baffled and frustrated by his claims. The officials said that their vote-tallying machines are not connected to the internet at all -- and that the specifics of Lindell\\'s allegations simply don\\'t add up.  Take Adams County, Pennsylvania, the home of the Gettysburg battlefield. Trump won the county with 37,567 votes, compared to 18,254 for Biden. Data included by Lindell in one of his videos and in court documents allege that 33,111 votes had been stolen from Trump after a hack on November 4 or November 5.JUST WATCHEDWatch Newsmax anchor walk off set during MyPillow CEO interviewReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch Newsmax anchor walk off set during MyPillow CEO interview 02:03Molly Mudd, the county solicitor, said that nearly all of the county\\'s ballots had been counted and reported by Election Night, November 3, before Lindell alleges the hack took place. And if Lindell\\'s claim about that many votes being swapped were correct, Mudd said in an email, \"then it would mean that Biden actually won Adams County (a heavily Republican-leaning county) by an unprecedented landslide, which is probably not the outcome that Mr. Lindell and his associates are fishing for.\"  Some officials said they were seeing the impact of election conspiracy theories spread by Lindell and others among their communities and neighbors. In Houghton County, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state\\'s Upper Peninsula, election officials have been deluged by emails from voters who believe their ballots were switched, said clerk Jennifer Kelly -- even though the county\\'s machines are separate from the internet. Some voters have complained at monthly county board meetings, and others have demanded to view the ballots themselves, she said. \"It\\'s the election that never ends,\" Kelly said.  And across the state in Oakland County, a Detroit suburb, election officials say they get regular phone calls from people claiming their votes were stolen, even after a canvass and two audits of the paper ballots verified the results. \"It\\'s very convenient to say after the fact, \\'oh, you know, it was hacked,\\'\" said Lisa Brown, the county clerk. \"This is a guy who sells pillows... I don\\'t know why anybody would want to listen to him as an expert on anything related to elections.\"  Vote-flipping theory has questionable originsLindell\\'s vote-flipping theories have striking similarities to a thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory -- advanced by a group of right-wing bloggers who have cited a former intelligence contractor with a checkered past -- that a supercomputer was used to steal votes from Trump across the country.  In \"Absolute Proof,\" Lindell includes a video of a map showing colorful lines and dots connecting the United States to other countries around the world -- which he claimed illustrated hacking election attempts from those countries.  Mike LIndell appearing in a scene from his video, \"Absolute Proof.\"A nearly identical graphic previously appeared on a website connected to Dennis Montgomery, a former intelligence contractor who has been the subject of multiple exposes detailing exaggerated claims and alleged cons involving junk data. A screen grab from a video called \"Foreign Interference - Coordinated Hack\" posted on Blxware.org, a website connected to Dennis Montgomery.Starting in 2013, Montgomery convinced former Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio to pay him more than $100,000 for data that supposedly showed an illegal conspiracy involving a federal judge. A detective for the sheriff\\'s office wrote in a 2014 email that the data contained \"no evidence to support\" Montgomery\\'s claims. And Montgomery and his associates previously received more than $20 million in federal government contracts for terrorism-fighting software that appeared to have been a hoax, The New York Times reported in 2011. Lindell co-produced \"Absolute Proof\" with right-wing online broadcaster Brannon Howse and a blogger who goes by the name Mary Fanning, both of whom were early promoters of the supercomputer conspiracy theory. In the video, Fanning calls Lindell as he shows the map graphic, and talks through what she claims were attempted and successful cyber attacks.  In multiple articles on her blog, The American Report, and discussions on Howse\\'s show, Fanning has attributed her beliefs about vote-flipping to Montgomery.  Lindell said in \"Absolutely 9-0\" that his unnamed sources gave him the data on January 9. And Howse said during an episode of his show that he and Fanning called Lindell on January 9 and shared their theory with him that same day.  \"We were talking, we\\'re like, who can we get some of this information to that has the courage and the guts to talk about this, take on this cause, bring it to the president?\" Howse said on the podcast. \"I said there\\'s only one guy in my Rolodex I know that has that kind of access, that kind of popularity and the guts to do it. And that\\'s Mike Lindell.\" In a January interview with Howse, Lindell said Howse and Fanning were the people who alerted him to \"the answers I was looking for\" about mass vote switching.  In the interview with CNN, Lindell said he hadn\\'t met Montgomery or Fanning and that he had multiple sources for his data. Montgomery, Fanning and Howse did not respond to CNN\\'s requests for comment.  Election lies and pillow promos Mike Lindell departs from federal court in Washington, DC, on June 24, 2021.According to Lindell, his advocacy for overturning the election has cost him millions of dollars in lost business. After his pillows were dropped by major retailers earlier this year, \"that\\'s 40% of my whole business wiped out in a blink of an eye,\" Lindell told CNN. Still, right-wing podcasts and shows that feature him often include promo codes for MyPillow. Voting machine company Dominion argued in its defamation lawsuit that Lindell used his prominence in pushing false election claims to bring in new business from Trump supporters -- although there are no public records about how the controversy has truly affected MyPillow\\'s finances. Last week, Lindell said MyPillow planned to stop advertising on Fox News, where its pillow ads are a common sight, because the channel won\\'t run a promo for his August event.  Trump has continued his ties to Lindell, speaking via video at a Wisconsin rally headlined by the MyPillow CEO in June. Lindell has said that after his big reveal this month, he expects the Supreme Court to rule 9-0 in favor of reinstating Trump as president -- even though there\\'s no constitutional mechanism for that to happen.  Experts agree that Lindell\\'s fanciful claims are fanciful and unsupported -- and are eroding trust in our democracy.  \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\" said Wallach, the Rice University professor. \"This ain\\'t that.\" CNN\\'s Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Audrey Ash and Jeffrey Winter contributed to this report.  (CNN)Nearly two decades ago, in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, a man named Mohammed al-Qahtani was captured on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Saudi national, US authorities alleged, was an al-Qaeda operative who was supposed to have been the \"20th hijacker\" but he failed to board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in rural Pennsylvania. After his capture, al-Qahtani was imprisoned, tortured by the US government and -- when charges against him were dropped in 2008 -- left to languish behind bars with no end in sight. Today, he sits in an isolated cell at Camp 6 in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he is one of only 39 detainees left in a facility that once housed approximately 680 so-called enemy combatants, a Department of Defense spokesperson confirmed to CNN. His attorneys have waged a protracted legal battle for al-Qahtani\\'s repatriation to Saudi Arabia. His quest for freedom is forcing the Biden administration to consider whether to release the 45-year-old man whose attorneys say is severely mentally ill battling schizophrenia, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his torture or seek to hold him indefinitely without charging him with a crime.   Read MoreAl-Qahtani\\'s case, experts say, stands as a litmus test for whether President Joe Biden is committed to his pledge to shutter the controversial facility -- an enduring symbol of the George W. Bush administration\\'s global \"war on terror\" that persisted through the Barack Obama and Donald Trump presidencies. And, they say, the case has troubling implications for the humane treatment of other prisoners of war, including any US servicemembers who may be captured in future conflicts.The challenge facing the Biden administration\\'s legal team is how to balance the merits of al-Qahtani\\'s case with the larger political realities at play, said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law who follows Guantanamo litigation. While there will be those who urge the President to side with the severely mentally ill detainee as part of the process of closing down Guantanamo, said Vladeck, others within the White House may advise Biden to consider the political drawbacks of any decision that may help set free a man who allegedly aspired to take part in the worst terrorist attack on US soil.  \"As much as the administration may wish to show compassion toward al-Qahtani, any broader effort to effectuate his release and that of the other 38 men still in detention there would require political capital that the administration is either unable or unwilling to spend,\" said Vladeck, who is a CNN legal analyst.Efforts to keep al-Qahtani in custody, however, have their own potential downsides. Biden has staked his foreign policy agenda on improving relations with US allies and changing America\\'s image abroad. He has sold his decisions to end combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq as moving the country forward from the perpetual \"war on terror\" footing it has operated on for nearly two decades. Keeping al-Qahtani in custody and Guantanamo open would not align with those stated goals, said Eric M. Freedman, a professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University who has long been critical of detentions at Guantanamo.\"The saga of this individual clearly exemplifies the layer upon layer of outrage that the entire Guantanamo venture has represented since its inception,\" Freedman said. \"If President Biden wants to adhere to his campaign promises to bring America back, freeing this man would be an excellent place to start.\"  Mental illness, extremism and captureThe Pakistani army captured al-Qahtani in December 2001 as he traveled with other suspected al-Qaeda fighters from remote Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan to cross into Pakistan.Al-Qahtani\\'s long history of mental illness began at age eight when he was in a serious car accident and thrown from the vehicle, suffering a traumatic brain injury, according to Dr. Emily Keram, a court-appointed psychiatrist hired at the request of defense attorneys to evaluate their client. Keram, who reviewed al-Qahtani\\'s Saudi medical records, said the injury impaired his ability to read and concentrate, which worsened with two more car accidents in later years.In the years that followed, al-Qahtani experienced \"episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol,\" according to Keram, who has interviewed al-Qahtani multiple times, including during two trips to Guantanamo Bay, since 2015. She also interviewed an older brother of al-Qahtani, one of 12 children in his family.At some point in his early 20s, al-Qahtani was found by Riyadh police naked in a garbage dumpster, Keram noted in her report. A few years later, police in the holy city of Mecca arrested al-Qahtani after he hurled himself into oncoming traffic, Keram said.  That incident resulted in his involuntary commitment to the psychiatric unit of the city\\'s King Abdul Aziz Hospital for four days where doctors determined he was delusional and suicidal, according to Keram, who also said he suffered from schizophrenia prior to entering US custody.Six months after leaving King Abdul Aziz Hospital, al-Qahtani started embracing a more extreme version of Islam and later attended an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, US authorities allege.Al-Qahtani\\'s \"psychological and cognitive deficits would be recognized by others, leading him to be vulnerable to manipulation and coercion,\" Keram wrote in a June 2016 assessment of al-Qahtani.At the camp, according to US military records, al-Qahtani met al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and swore his loyalty to him. Bin Laden personally selected him to take part in the 9/11 attacks, the records claim. On August 4, 2001, al-Qahtani landed in Orlando, Florida, with a one-way ticket and $4,000 in cash, which made immigration officials suspicious. They questioned him for 90 minutes before sending him back to Dubai. While military records allege that he was in Orlando to meet al-Qaeda member Mohamed Atta, one of the September 11 hijackers, they also note that al-Qahtani later told interrogators he didn\\'t know the purpose of the meet up. By the end of that month, al-Qahtani had returned to Afghanistan.Weeks later, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration embarked on a global manhunt to find the perpetrators that extended to the far reaches of Afghanistan\\'s remote eastern frontier.In December, as al-Qahtani traveled with other suspected al-Qaeda fighters from remote Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan to cross into Pakistan, he was captured by the Pakistani army at the border and transferred to US custody roughly two weeks later, military records show.Washington moved al-Qahtani to Guantanamo Bay on February 13, 2002, one of the first wave of detainees that arrived at the new facility.He became known as Detainee 063.  Military dogs, strangling and beatingsMohammed al-Qahtani, known as Detainee 063, was tortured over a roughly 50-day period between November 2002 and January 2003 at Camp X-Ray in the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp.For approximately 39 hours in May 2015, Keram met with al‐Qahtani in a bare interrogation room at Camp Echo, a former CIA black site in the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. She was there to evaluate the overall state of his mental health after more than 13 years of detention and whether he was receiving adequate medical and psychiatric care. When their conversations turned to his torture at Guantanamo, al-Qahtani often wept as he relived the ordeal.According to the government\\'s interrogation logs, which describe the torture in detail and were leaked to Time Magazine in 2005, al-Qahtani experienced some of the most severe \"enhanced interrogation\" techniques approved by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld under his authorized \"First Special Interrogation Plan.\" Rumsfeld infamously scribbled a note in the margins of a memo suggesting even harsher techniques.Over a roughly 50-day period between November 2002 and January 2003, al-Qahtani was subjected to a long list of brutal methods -- including sleep deprivation, extreme temperature and noise exposure, sexual humiliation, beatings and strangling, according to Keram\\'s report. At times, in apparent protest at his treatment, al-Qahtani refused to eat or drink water.Dehydrated, doctors would occasionally forcibly administer an IV, the logs show. In one instance, al-Qahtani bit an IV tube in two before he was restrained.Al-Qahtani\\'s interrogators also threatened him with military dogs and tied a leash to his shackles, led him around the room and forced him to perform a series of dog tricks. At times, they would not allow him to use the bathroom, resulting in him urinating on himself repeatedly, according to military records.Al-Qahtani told Keram that during his torture he experienced hallucinatory episodes. In one, he believed he was dead and seeing ghosts before an imaginary bird assured him that he was still alive. He told her that he wanted to end his life to stop the torture.Al-Qahtani was subjected to torture methods including sleep deprivation, extreme temperature and noise exposure, sexual humiliation, beatings and strangling.\"The intensity I had to kill myself was not the intensity to die, it was the intensity to stop the psychological torture, the horrible pain of solitary confinement,\" said al-Qahtani. \"The symptoms of psychological torture were horrific. It was even worse than the effects of the physical torture.\"During the sessions, interrogators allowed medical personnel inside the room to check al-Qahtani\\'s vitals signs -- sometimes three times a day. They were done to ensure he was \"able to continue\" with the interrogations, the records note.He was hospitalized on two occasions for an abnormally slow heart rate, according to military records. In one instance, officials flew in a radiologist from a naval station in Puerto Rico to read al-Qahtani\\'s CT scan after his heart rate dropped to 35 beats per minute. When the doctor found \"no anomalies\" al-Qahtani was \"hooded, shackled and restrained in a litter\" and taken back to Camp X-Ray for interrogations the following day, the logs report. On December 6, 2002 -- roughly two weeks after the interrogations began -- al-Qahtani told interrogators the story that he had met bin Laden in Afghanistan. \"I am doing this to get out of here,\" he said. He retracted the story the next day, saying that he had made the claim because he was under pressure.In an October 2008 memo, a military official alleged that al-Qahtani\\'s admission of involvement in bin Laden\\'s \"special mission to the US appear to be true and are corroborated in reporting from other sources.\" The document does not detail what information the military had or how it was corroborated.In the June 2016 evaluation, Keram concluded that al-Qahtani could not receive effective mental health treatment while he remains imprisoned at Guantanamo. She recommended his release to Saudi Arabia, where the government has said it would provide him psychiatric care.\"The profound physical and psychological torture Mr. al-Qahtani experienced during interrogations, coupled with his inability to control what was happening to him, led him to conclude that he had only two means of ending his suffering; suicide or compliance,\" wrote Keram of the torture sessions. \"Thus, Mr. al-Qahtani\\'s statements were coerced and not voluntary, reliable, or credible.\"Al-Qahtani\\'s condition has significantly deteriorated in the last year. He has tried to take his own life on three separate occasions in the last nine months during psychotic episodes driven by schizophrenic hallucinations, including by swallowing broken pieces of glass, his legal team says.\"The fact that somebody as sick as Mr. al-Qahtani poses some kind of security threat to the United States is unthinkable,\" said Scott Roehm, Washington director for The Center for Victims of Torture, a nonprofit that has pressured the Biden administration to close Guantanamo. CNN was unable to interview al-Qahtani for this article.This past February, Keram supplied another court declaration, writing that al-Qahtani was at \"high risk for suicide.\" Court ruling forces Biden White House to make decisionsAl-Qahtani was interrogated for 18 to 20 hours a day at Camp X-Ray.To probe the last 16 years of court records in al-Qahtani\\'s legal quest for freedom -- a cache of more than 400 filings between October 2005 and June 2021 -- is to take a journey through some of the most sordid moments in the recent history of the United States.The government dropped all charges against him in 2008, which Susan Crawford, a senior Bush administration official later admitted to The Washington Post was because he was tortured. Crawford served as the head of military commissions at Guantanamo Bay and was charged with deciding whether to bring detainees to trial. Any information gleaned during those sessions at Camp X-Ray, Crawford acknowledged, was inadmissible in court.The admission was unprecedented.Despite dropping the charges, the 2008 military memo argued for al-Qahtani\\'s continued detention, categorizing him as a \"high-risk\" to national security.Al-Qahtani\\'s legal team has made numerous efforts to secure his release, particularly after 2008 when charges against him were dropped. All were unsuccessful. In the face of those defeats, al-Qahtani\\'s lawyers decided in April 2017 to go down an untried legal route for Guantanamo detainees. As a prisoner of war, they argued, their client had the right under the Geneva Conventions to be granted a medical evaluation by an independent panel of three doctors, known as a mixed medical commission.Al-Qahtani\\'s lawyers argued that an independent medical evaluation was guaranteed under a US Army rule known as Army Reg. 190-8, a domestic law which allows for the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war.The strategy, according to al-Qahtani\\'s lawyers, was to see if other doctors agreed with Keram\\'s view that al-Qahtani was so mentally ill that he poses no threat to the United States and should be repatriated to Saudi Arabia. Justice Department lawyers contended that the Army rule did not apply to Guantanamo detainees.After years of disappointment, al-Qahtani and his legal team had its first significant victory. In March 2020, US District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer, in a 25-page opinion, ordered the US military to permit a mixed medical commission to examine al-Qahtani and determine his eligibility for repatriation to Saudi Arabia for psychiatric care.The judge\\'s order shook the Pentagon, which has consistently fought to block civilian courts from deciding the fate of Guantanamo detainees. The Trump administration appealed the order, which the DC Court of Appeals dismissed in September.A Pentagon spokesperson declined to comment for this article, citing al-Qahtani\\'s ongoing case.On January 15, in the waning days of Trump\\'s presidential term, the Justice Department made another bid to have Collyer\\'s ruling tossed out, filing a \"motion for reconsideration\" in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, citing a last-minute rule change instituted by then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy declaring Guantanamo detainees exempt from Army Reg. 190-8. The new rule, the government said, made the judge\\'s ruling moot. \"In the final hours of the Trump administration, they tried to move the goal posts,\" said Ramzi Kassem, a City University of New York law professor whose legal clinic represents al-Qahtani with The Center for Constitutional Rights. \"It\\'s the government, having lost under the law, then trying to change the law.\"In the back-and-forth of court filings, al-Qahtani\\'s attorneys have argued that the last-minute attempted rule change didn\\'t change the government\\'s obligation to adhere to the Geneva conventions. The Biden administration has now inherited the case and has on five occasions asked the court for an extension as it determines how it will proceed. It has until September 8 to decide which course of action to take: Continue to fight Collyer\\'s order, grant a mixed medical commission access to al-Qahtani, or drop the matter and repatriate him to Saudi Arabia.Wherever the White house falls, the potential moral, ethical and practical implications are significant.  Mohammed al-Qahtani has been held at Guantanamo Bay since February 2002 and since May 2008 without charge. Today, he is being held in a cell at Camp 6.The White House declined comment on al-Qahtani\\'s case, citing the pending litigation. If the Biden White House were to allow a mixed medical commission to examine al-Qahtani at Guantanamo, the first in the base\\'s history, he could set a precedent in which a number of other prisoners could request independent medical evaluations that could expose the conditions they have been subjected to for nearly two decades in some cases. If the government denies al-Qahtani a medical evaluation, however, and supports the Trump administration\\'s attempted unilateral carve out to exclude Guantanamo detainees from the Geneva Conventions, that could put US servicemembers captured as prisoners of war in peril. In a life-or-death scenario, those servicemembers could be denied the same type of treatment and medical evaluations al-Qahtani is now seeking, said Freedman.Looming in the background is the fierce debate over whether Guantanamo detainees are entitled to \"due process rights,\" a constitutional guarantee to fair treatment in court that is a bedrock of the American judicial system. Previous administrations have argued that such rights do not apply to them. The Biden administration\\'s legal team is divided on the issue, according to a recent New York Times report. The administration has yet to take a public stance on the matter. Recently, however, the Biden White House put its first stamp on Guantanamo policy on July 19, allowing the transfer of detainee, Abdul Latif Nasser, to Morocco. Because Nasser -- who was never charged with a crime -- had been cleared for repatriation in 2016, it\\'s unclear whether or not the move represents a significant shift in policy.Meanwhile, as the battle over the future of Guantanamo Bay plays out in Washington, al-Qahtani spends his days in isolation in his cell. He avoids other detainees because of his schizophrenic outbreaks, Keram noted in an August 2020 court declaration.In a recent phone conversation with his lawyer, Kassem, al-Qahtani said he survived on the hope of seeing his family again. The unclassified notes of that call, according to Kassem, reveal the desperation his client feels.\"There is no life for me here,\" al-Qahtani told his attorney. \"If I have a future, it is outside this place.\"  (CNN)Oklahoma pastor Jackson Lahmeyer\\'s quest to win a seat in the US Senate in his home state recently led him to the Phoenix coliseum that has become a beacon for the Trump faithful seeking to overturn the 2020 election.Lahmeyer is among a slew of 2022 political aspirants or lawmakers who\\'ve trekked to the site of the Arizona Senate\\'s \"audit,\" to cozy up to former President Donald J. Trump\\'s supporters and tie themselves to the phony notion that the election was stolen. Even though Trump won Oklahoma with 65.4 percent of the vote, Lahmeyer says he\\'s concerned: \"Do I believe there was voter fraud in Oklahoma in 2020? Yes,\" he told CNN, after visiting Arizona. \"I believe there was voter fraud in all 50 states ... Who could possibly believe the idea there were 80 million votes for Joe Biden?\" These GOP politicians have used the Arizona audit\\'s key role at the center of the stolen-election narrative to draw attention to their own 2022 campaigns, and as evidence of their commitment to Trump as they fundraise. Former Georgia state representative and gubernatorial candidate Vernon Jones visited the Arizona Senate\\'s audit in Phoenix on June 9, as seen in this post from an account tied to the audit. Among others who\\'ve made the journey: Vernon Jones, a former Georgia lawmaker who spoke at Trump\\'s Jan. 6 rally in DC, and is running to unseat Gov. Brian Kemp, whom he\\'s called \"a traitor;\" Chuck Gray, a Wyoming state house member mounting a primary challenge against Rep. Liz Cheney; Amanda Chase, a Virginia state senator who spoke in DC on Jan. 6, was censured by her state senate, and flirted with an independent candidacy after losing the GOP nomination for this November\\'s Virginia gubernatorial race; and Eric Greitens, who resigned as Missouri governor in 2018 amid reports he\\'d abused and blackmailed a woman with whom he was having an affair. Greitens admitted the affair but denied blackmailing her, and the charges against him were dropped. He is now running for the US Senate seat left open next year by Sen. Roy Blunt\\'s retirement. Read MoreHis cybersecurity firm is working on the Arizona \\'audit\\'. But people who know him have questions Trump himself is scheduled to visit Arizona this Saturday, where he looks to claim, yet again, that the Arizona audit will be the first domino in showing fraud in a string of states that Biden narrowly won, including Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.In this narrative, truth doesn\\'t merely take a back seat. It gets tossed to the side of the road. Take last week\\'s GOP briefing at Arizona\\'s state capitol, where Doug Logan, lead contractor on the review of ballots in Maricopa County, said \"we have 74,243 mail-in-ballots where there is no clear record of them being sent,\" and 11,326 people whom he said were not on the Nov. 7 voter rolls but showed up on the final roll of voters on Dec. 4.Election experts, analysts and reporters quickly debunked Logan\\'s claims online and in news stories, noting they seemed to be based on Logan misunderstanding or misstating how the voting process worked. But that didn\\'t matter. Within minutes, and in the week since, Donald Trump and a slew of GOP election conspiracists trumpeted these supposed findings across social media as \"proof\" the election was stolen. And candidates touting their fealty to Trump were quick to tweet, re-tweet or otherwise post Logan\\'s debunked claims and call for more audits. Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, (center) now running for a US Senate seat, poses with Arizona state senators Wendy Rogers and Sonny Borrelli before his June 12 tour of the Arizona Senate\\'s audit site. From the start, with Arizona Senate President Karen Fann hiring the Cyber Ninjas firm, a little-known firm inexperienced in election audits, run by a man who\\'d repeated wild conspiratorial fraud claims; to the review being funded with great secrecy by private, likely partisan sources; through the company initially handing auditors blue pens until a reporter pointed out they could be used to change how ballots are read; to, more recently, contractors sending reams of vote data off to a mysterious cabin in Montana, in the latest portion of the audit, the Arizona vote review has been fraught.There could scarcely be a deeper canyon than the one between how election experts see the audit and how Trump-backing GOP candidates describe it.  \"Was this deliberate from day one for fundraising?\" asked Harri Hursti, founder of Nordic Innovation Labs, and a data-security expert who recently completed a conventional election audit in New Hampshire, about the Arizona vote review. \"This whole thing is theater ... it\\'s all smoke and mirrors and theater.\" The New Hampshire audit, by contrast, found that a borrowed folding machine in the town of Windham caused 400 ballots to be improperly counted, but that there was \"no basis to believe that the miscounts found in Windham indicate a pattern of partisan bias or a failed election.\" Trey Grayson, a Republican and former Kentucky Secretary of State, co-wrote a recent report on the Arizona audit for the States United Democracy Center, a nonprofit focused on fair and secure elections. It detailed huge flaws in the audit\\'s processes, poor security, high levels of built-in error and other problems. \"If you are a Republican who has concerns about this election, you shouldn\\'t trust the outcome of this review in Arizona,\" Grayson told CNN.\"Routine audits of vote counts are important,\" said Mark Lindeman, acting co-director of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan election-integrity nonprofit that earlier this year worked with Georgia on a full hand count of its vote and with Pennsylvania on a risk-limiting election audit.  Both indicated that the original results were substantially accurate. Arizona audit funding cloaked in secrecyBut in Arizona, he said, \"The problem seems to be that Trump lost, and that\\'s what they\\'re trying to fix; but that\\'s not what audits do.\" He called the procedures Cyber Ninjas and the other subcontractors in Arizona are following bizarre, adding, \"It\\'s a process that can only raise more questions, muddy the waters ... None of it makes much sense, except as a way to increase doubt.\" Maricopa County\\'s GOP-led Board of Supervisors also has termed the Arizona Senate\\'s audit unnecessary, with board chairman Jack Sellers last week issuing a statement that, \"It\\'s clear the people hired by Arizona Senate leadership to supposedly bring integrity to our elections are instead just bringing incompetence.\" But many of the GOP candidates and lawmakers visiting Arizona, who have eagerly fomented lies about the 2020 vote, and embraced vicious and radical rhetoric about those who disagree with them, dismiss such criticisms.  \"I don\\'t care what a GOP board says; you have a lot of RINOs occupying positions they should not be in,\" said Oklahoma\\'s Lahmeyer, using the term for \"Republicans in name only.\" Lahmeyer, who touts his endorsement from disgraced former Gen. Michael Flynn, and hopes to unseat GOP Sen. James Lankford in 2022, termed Lankford \"a traitor,\" for voting on Jan. 6 to certify President Biden\\'s victory. As of June 30, Lahmeyer reported raising just more than $250,000 to the Federal Election Commission. Lankford\\'s FEC reports show he\\'d raised $2.3 million as of that date. \"Absolutely,\" the election was stolen from Trump, said Gray, the Wyoming lawmaker challenging Cheney. Trump has regularly attacked Cheney for voting to impeach him and for rejecting his claims the election was stolen, scurrilous claims and nonsensical rhetoric Gray eagerly echoed.  \"We\\'ve ... got to expose the truth, got to stop the fake news media, Liz Cheney and the coalition of radical socialists,\" he said. Jones, the former Georgia lawmaker, has called Gov. Kemp \"a traitor\" for rejecting election fraud claims. Asked about his visit to the Arizona audit and his claims of fraud in Georgia, Jones said, \"It has helped my campaign. From day one, I\\'ve talked about things I described as violation of the Constitution, the procedures followed in counting absentee ballots.\" His fundraising website specifically asks for contributions to \"ensure that Georgia\\'s elections are never stolen by Democrats again.\" Lawmakers and candidates from Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, too, have visited Arizona amid calls for audits in their states. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the visits of the four Wisconsin lawmakers were paid for by OAN personality Christina Bobb\\'s Voices and Votes nonprofit. None of the four nor Bobb responded to interview requests by CNN. Bobb has said on her website she\\'s raising funds for the audit. Chase, the Virginia lawmaker, said she plans to push for an audit in Virginia when its legislature goes into session in August. \"I do believe there were irregularities and an organized effort by Democrats to steal the election from President Trump, and thousands of votes flipped. There needs to be a forensic audit in every state,\" she said. And in Arizona, where term-limited Gov. Doug Ducey won\\'t be running for reelection, at least two GOP candidates for governor have echoed on social media Logan\\'s debunked claims about election problems. Lindeman, of Verified Voting, sighed during a discussion of such claims, and said that while election audits can always be improved, \"they were better in 2020 than they have ever been.\"\"There is no rational basis for the notion that something terrible happened in November 2020 and we have to keep investigating and investigating until we find it,\" he said, adding that, \"what\\'s been lost is any shared national commitment to look for facts.\"   (CNN)On a sunny morning in February, as a bagpipe rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" filled the salt air, Ashli Babbitt\\'s family and friends scattered her ashes into the Pacific Ocean off San Diego.The ceremony, aboard a chartered boat, was supposed to be a final goodbye for the 35-year-old Air Force veteran and fervent Donald Trump supporter who was fatally shot in the US Capitol on Jan. 6.Babbitt was shot once in the shoulder by an unidentified Capitol police lieutenant while attempting to crawl through a broken window leading to the Speaker\\'s Lobby outside the US House of Representatives\\' chamber. The shooting was captured on video and went viral for the world to see. The lieutenant has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing.But nearly six months after she was slain, Babbitt\\'s memory not only lives on, it has become as polarizing and as politicized as the day itself.To some Americans on the right, she\\'s a patriot who died a martyr\\'s death. To others on the left, she\\'s a domestic terrorist who got what she deserved -- a sentiment conveyed with its own Twitter hashtag, #SheWasATerrorist. Read More\"She is the tragedy of the modern Republican voter personified,\" liberal political commentator Bill Maher proclaimed in January. \"She died for a second Trump term even though that would have solved exactly none of her problems.\"Her image adorns a black \"martyr flag\" with the Capitol in the background that is being circulated on right-wing social media and appears in a painting reminiscent of the revolutionary war era entitled \"Daughter of Liberty.\"\"She is going to be used for many, many years,\" said Simon Purdue, a fellow at the UK-based Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, who last month wrote an article on the significance of Babbitt\\'s supposed martyrdom as a recruiting tool. \"The more they mention her, the more dangerous her story is going to be.\"In interviews with CNN, Babbitt\\'s mother and brother, Michelle and Roger Witthoeft, spoke openly about her life before the shooting, their perspectives on what led her to the Capitol that day and their contention that she did not deserve to be shot.To her family, the life Babbitt lived for 35 years was suddenly eclipsed by what they see as a distorted portrait that has emerged following her death, based in part on her own social media postings and videos in which she rants about her conservative political views and support of Donald Trump.Ashli Babbitt touted Donald Trump \"every single day all day long,\" her mother said.Because of this and her high-profile role on Jan. 6, they say, the death of an unarmed woman who spent more than a decade in service to her country and who had no previous criminal convictions has been met with a collective shrug by the government and mainstream media.Politics aside, \"she was a person,\" her mother said, her voice cracking with emotion.As for the videos, Roger Witthoeft said, \"you\\'re getting two minutes of 35 years. You don\\'t know what she was like.\"\"So many people either love my sister or they hate her,\" he said. \"Most of them have never met her.\"\\'The Enforcer\\'Ashli Elizabeth Babbitt grew up a tomboy in a suburb of San Diego. She kept pace with four brothers and their friends, riding bikes, jumping them over ramps, skateboarding and \"playing in the dirt,\" Witthoeft recalled. \"She just did boy things,\" he said. \"Me and my sister were best friends.\"Ashli Babbitt with her brother Roger Witthoeft in 2015.Babbitt excelled at water polo in high school. Despite her small stature, she was a hard-charging player, earning her the nickname \"The Enforcer.\" She signed up for the Air Force at age 17. Her parents had to accompany her to the recruiting office do so.\"She was brave. She came out that way. Always was that way,\" her mother said. \"She always wanted to go into the military. 9-11 strengthened her conviction.\"Babbitt spent four years on active duty, from 2004 through 2008, achieving the rank of senior airman. She went on to serve as an Air Force reservist from 2008 to 2010 and in the Air National Guard from 2010 to 2016, according to records released by the Air Force Personnel Center. Her service included deployments to Afghanistan in 2005, Iraq in 2006, and the United Arab Emirates in 2012 and 2014, according to an Air Force spokesperson. While with the Air National Guard, she was a member of the 113th Security Forces Squadron of the DC Air National Guard based at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. The unit, whose mission is to protect the DC area during periods of civil unrest, is nicknamed the Capital Guardians.\\'Always there\\'Witthoeft said his sister never let distance get in the way of her relationship with family members, whom she developed a habit of surprising with unannounced visits from across the country or around the world.\"You\\'d hear your dog barking at 2:30 in the morning and you\\'d open the door and it would be Ashli,\" her brother recalled \"Caught a flight home!\" she\\'d say.He recalled one episode when he was feeling particularly down and called his sister, who was living in Maryland, to vent.When he got home from work the next day, she was waiting at his front door. \"She\\'s probably running around packing her bags as I\\'m on the phone with her,\" he recalled. \"Ashli was just always there in the time of need.\" Witthoeft said he doesn\\'t recall his sister always being so consumed by politics. Years ago, he said, she voted for Barack Obama.\"She just would do her research and whoever she thought was the best candidate was the best candidate,\" he said. \"In her opinion Obama was the better person at the time.\"In 2017, after more than a decade away, Babbitt returned to Southern California. She bought a pool service company that she ran with her brother Roger and her future husband, Aaron, who did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this article.Ashli Babbitt in a photo from her since removed Twitter account. A shift to the rightBabbitt\\'s politics, meanwhile, had shifted to the right from her days as an Obama supporter, according to a pair of videos from 2018.In one video, which appears to be shot in her kitchen, Babbitt speaks in an animated tone about homelessness and border security and calls out Democratic politicians for \"refusing to acknowledge or even admit that we do need the wall.\"\"The border is an absolute shit show,\" she said. \"There\\'s riots, there\\'s arrests, there\\'s rapes, there\\'s drugs ... there are tons of issues.\"\"I want my politicians to start coming down here and telling me that my reality is a lie,\" she said.She recorded another video around the same time from her car. She seems agitated, her voice impassioned, as she calls out then-Sen. Kamala Harris and fellow Democrats for failing to deal with homelessness, drugs and illegal immigration. \"Where is Kamala? Where is Kamala?\" Babbitt says, sounding exasperated. \"You guys refuse to choose America over your stupid political party.\"\"This is absolutely insane,\" she says moments later, her eyes darting back and forth between the camera and the road. \"This is crazy.\"She became an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, proudly wearing a bright red Make America Great Again hat and attending as many of his rallies as she could, her brother said. She was prolific on Twitter, using the name @CommonAshSense, where she spread QAnon theories, attacked the credibility of the mainstream media and, after the pandemic hit, railed against Covid-19 restrictions. By 2019, her pool service company appeared to be struggling financially and was hit with a $70,000 judgment following a lawsuit by a company that provided a cash advance in exchange for a cut of future earnings. Witthoeft said the financial situation for the company was not dire and that Babbitt remained positive about the future of the company.  \"The financial stuff will pass,\" he quoted her as saying. \"It\\'s just a hiccup. Nothing lasts forever.\" Earlier this year, a sign on the door of the pool supply company proclaimed, \"mask free autonomous zone, better known as America,\" according to a photo published by The Associated Press. A sign outside Babbitt\\'s San Diego area pool supply company on Jan. 7, 2021. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)Witthoeft, who spends his off hours surfing and working out, said he does not pay attention to social media and was largely oblivious to the increasing intensity of his sister\\'s political views before Jan. 6. \"That whole world ain\\'t my game,\" he said. He had no idea his sister was bound for Washington, DC in early January, he said. \\'Nothing will stop us\\'On her flight to Washington, Babbitt took a selfie in which she\\'s wearing a Trump 2020 mask. \"Tons of Trump supporters on my plane!!!!\" she wrote in a text to her husband. \"Be safe,\" he replied. \"I cannot lose you.\" \"Nothing will stop us,\" Babbitt Tweeted on Jan. 5. \"They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours.\" She ended the Tweet with the words \"dark to light!\" a phrase commonly associated with the QAnon conspiracy theory regarding an ongoing battle between good and evil.  JUST WATCHEDThese are the key moments from the US Capitol riotReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThese are the key moments from the US Capitol riot 04:47On the afternoon of the 6th, Babbitt filmed herself amid a throng of fellow Trump supporters walking toward the capitol.\"There\\'s an estimated over three million people here today,\" she said, \"so despite what the media tells you, boots on ground definitely say something different.\" The size of the crowd was actually a small fraction of Babbitt\\'s estimate, likely in the tens of thousands at most based on various projections and protest permit applications. A short time later, around 2:45 p.m., she is captured on cell phone video attempting to climb through the window into the Speaker\\'s Lobby, a Trump flag around her like a cape.  There is a loud bang and she falls backward into the crowd of people behind her.\\'Invincible\\'Witthoeft was at work with his younger brother when they got a panicked call from their father. \"Your sister\\'s been shot in DC,\" he told them.  \"It was one of only two times I\\'ve ever seen my father cry -- I mean, go down to your knees, sobbing like a kid, cry,\" Witthoeft said.A day or so later a pair of FBI agents knocked on the door of the bungalow he shares with two of his brothers a few blocks from the beach. They were asking questions about Babbitt, Witthoeft recalled, and seemed skeptical that she\\'d traveled to DC all on her own and managed to find herself at the center of the mele without any help or planning. Witthoeft chuckled as he recalled the episode. He said he told the agents he was unaware of his sister conspiring with anyone and doubted she had. \"You don\\'t know my sister,\" he said. \"That is exactly something she would do. That\\'s who she was.\"Ever since they were kids, he said, she\\'d exhibited extraordinary determination and discipline when it came to something she cared about, obstacles be damned. Her motto for when the going got tough, he said, was \"hydrate and press on.\" \"She was invincible,\" Witthoeft said. \"That\\'s the way I looked at her.\"Michelle Witthoeft said answers were hard to come by in the days and weeks following her daughter\\'s death. She was repeatedly brushed off by the Capitol police and various politicians, she said. In some cases, people were \"downright rude.\"  In February, Babbitt\\'s family scattered her ashes in the Pacific Ocean off Point Loma, not too far from where she and her husband used to walk their three dogs. At the time, they held out hope that the officer who shot her would be held accountable. But federal prosecutors announced in April that they found \"insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution\" of the officer who shot Babbitt. Prosecutors won\\'t pursue charges in shooting death of Ashli Babbitt during Capitol riotOfficer\\'s actions \\'nothing short of heroic\\'A press release from the US Attorney\\'s office in Washington, DC said investigators examined video footage posted on social media and considered the statements of the officer who fired the fatal shot, other officers and witnesses at the scene, as well as physical evidence and the findings of an autopsy. The two-page release contained a brief summary of the incident which painted a tense scene in which Capitol police officers had constructed a makeshift barrier of furniture to block a mob from forcing entry into the Speaker\\'s Lobby and chamber of the House of Representatives from which members of Congress were being evacuated. \"Members of the mob attempted to break through the doors by striking them and breaking the glass with their hands, flagpoles, helmets and other objects,\" the release states. \"Ms. Babbitt attempted to climb through one of the doors where glass was broken out. An officer inside the Speaker\\'s Lobby fired one round from his service pistol, striking Ms. Babbitt in the left shoulder,\" the release said. She died a short time later at a local hospital. Prosecutors said their probe was focused on whether the officer violated Babbitt\\'s civil rights by willfully using excessive force against her. \"The investigation revealed no evidence,\" the US attorneys\\' office wrote, \"that the officer did not reasonably believe he was acting in self-defense, or in defense of the Members of Congress and others evacuating the House Chamber.\" The release did not specify the shooting officer\\'s stated reason for pulling the trigger, nor did it say why other officers present did not shoot. Terry Roberts, a Maryland attorney retained by Babbitt\\'s family, said in a recent interview with CNN that he intends to file a civil rights lawsuit alleging that she was a victim of excessive force. Roberts said there was no indication that the lieutenant issued a warning before opening fire and that if he had, Babbitt, a former military police officer, would have heeded that warning. \"He didn\\'t need a bullet to stop her,\" Roberts said in a brief telephone interview with CNN. \"It was excessive.\" Roberts said he filed a claim that is a precursor to a lawsuit with the Capitol Police in April. He declined to provide a timetable for when the anticipated case would be filed.Attorney Mark Schamel, who represents the Capitol police lieutenant who shot Babbitt, said in a statement issued after the DOJ announcement that the officer \"saved the lives of countless members of Congress\" by stopping the rioters from gaining entry to the Speaker\\'s Lobby. \"His bravery on January 6 was nothing short of heroic,\" Schamel said. Senate report reveals new details about security failures ahead of January 6 attack but omits Trump\\'s roleLast month, Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Gosar, a vocal Trump supporter who backed efforts to overturn the election, sought to undermine the notion that Babbitt was killed in an act of self-defense.  He did so during a House oversight committee hearing in which he questioned a former Justice Department official about the events of Jan. 6. \"Who executed Ashli Babbitt?\" Gosar asked. \"A woman, a veteran, was killed in the U.S. Capitol and her family and country deserve answers,\" the Congressman tweeted a week later. \"Say her name.\" Purdue, the fellow from the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, drew parallels between the rhetoric surrounding Babbitt\\'s death and that of Vicki Weaver. Weaver was the wife of White separatist Randy Weaver who was fatally shot by an FBI sniper during a standoff with federal agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992. The Weavers\\' teenage son was also killed a day earlier as was a US marshal. Vicki Weaver\\'s \"perceived status as an innocent, white, female victim of \\'state aggression\\' instantly placed her on a pedestal,\" Purdue wrote. Her death in particular became a rallying cry and recruiting tool on the far right and helped inspire Oklahoma City bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.\"We\\'re seeing similarities in the way Ashli Babbitt is being treated,\" Purdue said in an interview with CNN. \"They\\'re talking about the death of Ashli Babbitt as proof that the state has gone too far. It\\'s proof that a revolution is necessary.\"\\'Trump rallied his troops\\'Roger Witthoeft has since replayed the final moments of his sister\\'s life countless times on the internet. \"One of the hardest parts about seeing the video is you want to grab her and shake her and be like damn it, Ashli. Why\\'d you have to do that?\" he said. \"What the hell were you thinking?\" That does not mean Witthoeft thinks his sister deserved to get shot -- he does not. The muscular weightlifter says he\\'d like five minutes alone in a room with the officer that shot her. Not to hurt him, he said, but to hear what was going through his mind when he pulled the trigger.\"I don\\'t agree with the decision, and I\\'m angry as a brother,\" he said. \"But I don\\'t think anyone wakes up in the morning and goes, \\'I want to go take a life today,\\' so I\\'d be interested to talk to him.\" Witthoeft said he understood that his sister\\'s political messaging online and in her videos may \"have been a little heated and delivered wrong,\" but that didn\\'t mean she wasn\\'t entitled to her opinion.   He said she\\'d spent most of her adult life in the military defending the freedom of others to speak their minds. \"I feel like she went to the Capitol because she felt like her voice wasn\\'t being heard,\" he said. Michelle Witthoeft bristled at the notion that her daughter was an insurrectionist. \"To have to defend my daughter\\'s patriotism blows my mind, because she loved this country more than anybody I know,\" she said. \"She was there to express her First Amendment right and to answer the call of a still sitting president.\" Though she, too, had been a Trump supporter, Michelle Witthoeft said she didn\\'t appreciate the way the former President has behaved in the wake of her daughter\\'s death. \"Donald Trump rallied his troops and Ashli was definitely [one of] his troops,\" she said. \"I think he could have intervened and spoken out on my daughter\\'s behalf just one little iota as much as she touted for him every single day all day long.\" She makes no apologies for her daughter\\'s conduct and said she takes comfort in the fact that she was \"in her moment\" up until the second she was shot. She called her daughter \"a true patriot, in every sense of the word.\" \"She walked the walk,\" her mother said. \"She didn\\'t just talk the talk.\"   (CNN)In recent weeks, GOP lawmakers from at least 16 states have flocked to Phoenix for a first-hand look at a controversial, partisan \"audit\" of the 2020 vote in Arizona\\'s largest county. The visits look to be a harbinger for similar exercises yet-to-come in those other states -- and a potential revenue stream for, among others, the Arizona effort\\'s main contractor: Cyber Ninjas.Never heard of Cyber Ninjas before the Arizona audit began two months ago? You are not alone. Arizona audit funding cloaked in secrecyThough the Florida-based cybersecurity firm has existed in some form since at least 2014, before last November\\'s election, it hadn\\'t done election auditing, nor been in the public eye. But then, there hasn\\'t been much of it to be in the public eye. Cyber Ninjas exists mostly in virtual reality, with its chief executive, Doug Logan, also serving as, well, pretty much everything. Read MoreOn recent calls to the company\\'s automated answer line, pressing \"3\" for sales led to the answering message for Logan. So did pressing \"4\" for human resources. And pressing \"5\" for purchasing. And \"6\" for the general mailbox. Go to the address for Cyber Ninjas\\' Legal Department, listed on its audit contract with the Arizona Senate, and you\\'ll wind up at a rented mailbox in a UPS Store in Sarasota, Florida. The company\\'s business address registered with Florida\\'s Secretary of State, also in Sarasota, was sold last December, and now sits empty.  Cyber Ninjas owner Doug Logan, a Florida-based consultancy, talks about overseeing a 2020 election ballot audit ordered by the Republican lead Arizona Senate at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, during a news conference Thursday, April 22, 2021, in Phoenix. Logan himself has strenuously avoided speaking to reporters since taking part in an April 22 press conference just before the audit began. At that conference, he refused to answer questions about how he\\'d repeated and amplified various debunked election-fraud conspiracy theories on social media, such as this retweet unearthed by the Arizona Mirror, for example: \"I\\'m tired of hearing people say there was no fraud. It happened, it\\'s real, and people better get wise fast.\" He\\'d also provided, in a Michigan election lawsuit, an affidavit alleging vulnerabilities in one county\\'s system for tallying votes; state and county officials disagreed, identified a slew of problems with the analysis. And Logan repeated disproven claims in a paper he wrote for Republican US senators objecting to Congress\\'s Jan. 6 certification of President Joe Biden\\'s election win. But Logan, and the Arizona Senate\\'s audit liaison, Ken Bennett, argued at that press conference that Logan\\'s own opinions don\\'t matter, and that people should trust in the integrity of the audit process he\\'s overseeing. Logan declined interview requests from CNN. An emailed statement from his spokesman, Rod Thomson, stated that \"Mr. Logan recognizes President Biden\\'s results were certified and accepted in accordance with the Constitution. Mr. Logan remains committed to restoring integrity and trust into our election system, which he is demonstrating through the work he is performing here in Maricopa County.\"But that\\'s a tough sell, even to Logan\\'s friends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard to say anything bad about the guy. He\\'s a lovely person. He\\'s just nuts now,\" said Tony Summerlin, who has been friends with Logan for 15 years, and said he helped him win a cybersecurity contract with the Federal Communications Commission five years ago. \"It\\'s scary; because if someone like him can turn into this, who can\\'t turn into this?\" Summerlin said that in all the years he\\'d known Logan, before the Arizona audit, \"we never, never had a single political conversation; that\\'s what stunned me about this... He said, \\'there\\'s definitely something there.\\' I said, \\'based on what?\\' He said, \\'it\\'ll come.\\' I said, \\'you sound like the My Pillow guy.\\'\"Another friend of Logan, who asked not to be named because she works with both Republicans and Democrats in Washington, DC, and feared blowback from being linked to him, described him as very smart, very competent in cybersecurity, and politically naïve. \"Doug may not have thought it all the way through,\" she said.

Summerlin said he first met Logan in 2005 or 2006. \"He was in DC trying to get business with the government for his firm, which at that point was him. He seemed like a smart guy.\"  In 2010, in New York, Logan competed in the first US Cyber Challenge, a national program to identify and develop cybersecurity talent. He went on to become a Cyber Challenge instructor, and helped develop a workshop for the curriculum, according to a person familiar with his work at the program. In March 2014, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported that Sarasota County\\'s Economic Development Corporation was helping Logan relocate his company, Cyber Ninjas, to the city, \"with plans to eventually add eight to 10 employees.\" The paper said Logan was moving there from Bloomington, Indiana, where he\\'d also worked for the software security company Cigital. Logan and his company have a trail of positive reviews posted on his LinkedIn page for cybersecurity consulting work in the private sector. He and Cyber Ninjas also received a three-year, $101,000 federal cybersecurity contract with the Federal Communications Commission in 2016, and subsequently, Summerlin said, worked for the Universal Services Administrative Company, a private-public partnership under the FCC that provides broadband services to underserved communities and schools, among other work. None of that previous consulting appears to have any ties to election-related matters. In April 2020, Cyber Ninjas received a Covid assistance loan for $98,322, saying in its application it then had five employees.JUST WATCHEDCNN confronts woman behind bogus Arizona auditReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN confronts woman behind bogus Arizona audit 05:23Logan, in materials for a cybersecurity conference in Chicago last November, described himself as a father of 11 children and a \"Follower of Jesus Christ.\"  But also in November, within days of Trump\\'s election loss, Logan was messaging Ron Watkins. The recent HBO documentary \"Q: Into the Storm,\" pointed to Watkins as either being \"Q\" or at least a key promulgator of the QAnon conspiracy theories that helped animate many of those who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6. Watkins is the former administrator of the internet message-board website 8chan, now 8kun, effectively QAnon\\'s home base. In a series of archived tweets from a now-deleted account between Nov. 12 and December, first reported by The Daily Beast, Logan messaged Watkins, \"I\\'d love to chat if you have a chance;\" asked Watkins for links to \"original source documents;\" and tagged Watkins on his exchanges with attorneys Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, who filed numerous lawsuits challenging Biden\\'s victory and baselessly claiming electoral fraud. Wood also told a reporter for Talking Points Memo that Logan had visited his home in South Carolina to meet with others \"working on the investigation into election fraud.\"  Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, who hired Cyber Ninjas, dismissed concerns about Logan\\'s tweets and other indications he might be biased as \"tiny little things.\" Some others don\\'t see them as quite so tiny. Arizona mail in ballot auditDouglas Cobb, owner of Paper Forensics, a Savannah, Georgia-based document examination firm, shared emails with CNN showing he was approached in April by another Cyber Ninjas subcontractor, Haystack Investigations, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, to join the Arizona \"audit.\" The emails were first reported by the Arizona Republic.Cobb said he was asked to provide up to 20 people for 14 days to examine the ballot paper, at a rate of $600 a day plus expenses per person and $800 a day for himself. That total, just over $179,000 plus expenses, is more than the Arizona Senate contracted to pay Cyber Ninjas for the audit as a whole: $150,000. As CNN has reported, private partisan sources heavily invested in casting doubt on Biden\\'s election victory claim to have funneled more than $1.6 million to the audit. Neither Fann, nor the Senate, nor Logan, have said how much in private funding Cyber Ninjas has received or spent. At the April 22 press conference, Logan said he didn\\'t know how much his company was being paid, and didn\\'t want to know, because \"I don\\'t want to be influenced.\" Cobb had planned to work on the audit -- until his son looked online into the people he\\'d be working for. \"I withdrew once I found out a little more about who was involved, Cyber Ninjas and Logan and his conspiracy theories,\" Cobb said. Logan didn\\'t answer questions from CNN about who is accounting for funds received and spent for the audit; about whether he\\'s been approached by legislators from other states to do similar work; about whether his company has an actual office or any full-time employees; about how he and his company came to Fann\\'s attention; or about whether he still believes the conspiracies he touted months ago to GOP US senators, such as debunked allegations of fraud in counties in Georgia and Pennsylvania, or debunked claims that Dominion Voting System\\'s core software originates from intellectual property of Smartmatic, and is linked through Smartmatic to Venezuela\\'s long-dead former president Hugo Chavez, among others. Questions about Logan\\'s beliefs continue to surface. On June 3, when conspiracy theorist and Overstock founder Patrick Byrne released a trailer for a film about the Arizona audit, claiming the election was stolen from Trump, several Arizona reporters immediately pointed to an anonymous speaker, identified only as an \"ANON, Application Security Analyst,\" as sounding exactly like Doug Logan. Summerlin, too, said he recognized Logan\\'s voice. On the trailer, the speaker says, \"if we don\\'t fix our election integrity now, we may no longer have a democracy.\" Shortly after several reporters tweeted about Logan and the trailer, a re-edited version of the trailer was substituted on YouTube with the voice for that speaker digitally altered. Logan didn\\'t respond to queries about whether that was his voice on the trailer, which has now been removed for violating YouTube\\'s community guidelines. The last time he spoke publicly about the audit, on April 22, Logan told reporters, \"I know you guys want to paint me like some bad guy in here. I\\'m involved in this and putting everything on the line with my company because I care about our country. ... Otherwise, who would be stupid enough to walk into this? Every individual that walks into any election integrity thing gets butchered by everybody.\"Summerlin said Logan recently contacted him to ask for his help, saying that the Universal Service Administrative Company had terminated Cyber Ninjas\\' contract. Neither Logan nor the USAC responded to questions from CNN about the alleged contract termination. \"He said, \\'it\\'s wrong they\\'re terminating me,\\'\" Summerlin said. \"I said, \\'don\\'t be an idiot, of course they\\'re terminating your ass, you work at will.\\' I said, \\'if you get a government contract any time after this, I\\'ll be amazed.\"  (CNN)Three weeks into the Arizona Senate\\'s unorthodox audit of the 2020 presidential election results, one potential winner seems to be emerging, regardless of any count: Cyber Ninjas, the Florida-based consulting firm being paid to lead the analysis of the votes in populous Maricopa County.Private fundraisers have boasted that they\\'re funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to the effort led by the security consulting firm, a company not previously known for election auditing. But there\\'s little or no scrutiny on where that money is going or how it\\'s being used. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\nA CNN review of state records shows no contractual provisions or safeguards controlling how much money Cyber Ninjas can accept from private contributors, how it can be spent, or even whether it needs to account to the Senate for those funds. In fact, the Senate\\'s spokesman for the audit acknowledged that the Senate isn\\'t exercising any oversight or control over Cyber Ninjas\\' use of the private funds, which are expected to support the majority of the auditing efforts. The way the funding for the work is structured appears to skirt state transparency laws, CNN\\'s review found.Meanwhile, with few restrictions on the scope of its work, Cyber Ninjas, which presents itself as primarily focused on application security, has dived into baseless conspiracy theories, such as looking for bamboo traces in ballots to determine whether ballot boxes were stuffed with fraudulent votes from an unknown Asian country. Read MoreAlong the way, it has made fundamental blunders in the way election audits are traditionally conducted, such as initially providing workers with blue-ink pens that can alter how tabulators read ballots; security lapses that allowed people access to what should have been secure areas before the audit began; allowing a former lawmaker who appeared on the ballot to be involved in verifying them; and planning door-to-door canvassing of voters before the Department of Justice warned such a move could violate federal laws against voter intimidation. Senate President Karen Fann, a Republican, told the DOJ that the Senate would \"indefinitely defer\" the planned canvass.A hidden stream of funds2020 ballots relocated in semi trucks as Arizona election audit pauses over space availabilityThe GOP-controlled Arizona Senate allocated $150,000 to the audit, one third paid up front. But that money was expected to cover just a fraction of the work. Now, as state officials project that the audit will continue into the summer, with just 500,000 of the 2.1 million ballots hand-counted to date, the costs keep climbing.To fuel that effort, Ken Bennett, the Senate\\'s audit liaison, Fann and others have welcomed private donations. And Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists have jumped in, publicly stumping for funds and claiming to have funneled more than $1.6 million to the audit, while offering scant information about where that money is flowing.Having the audit funded by \"undisclosed private money, especially from people who back conspiracy theories about the conduct of the 2020 election, is extremely worrisome,\" said Rick Hasen, author of \"Election Meltdown: Dirty Tricks, Distrust and the Threat to American Democracy.\" \"It suggests those people are funding this because they want to see a particular result.\" Two prior publicly-funded audits of Maricopa County ballots and election machinery used in the November election found no evidence of widespread fraud or voting irregularities. President Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes, his narrowest margin of the states he won. Maricopa County ballots cast in the 2020 general election are examined and recounted by contractors working for Florida-based Cyber Ninjas, on May 6, at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Matt York, Pool)Even as Fann and other audit leaders say they\\'re focused on improving future elections, former President Donald Trump and his allies -- including some Arizona legislators -- are treating the audit here as, in effect, the first domino in amplifying claims of electoral fraud in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, among others. On a local TV program May 5, Fann said first that the audit is \"not about overturning the election;\" then, a minute later, added, \"I think we\\'re going to find some irregularities, that it\\'s going to say... \\'yeah, there\\'s this many dead people that may have voted, or this many people that voted that don\\'t live here anymore.\\' We\\'re going to find those. We know those exist.\" Arizona law covering state bodies that receive public and private funding requires the recipient to report the sources of the private donations and any strings attached; to deposit private funds in a separate account with the State Treasurer; and to account for every expenditure with the state\\'s Department of Administration.  In this case, however, the Senate is arguing that the audit isn\\'t subject to these provisions -- because the donations are being channeled straight to Cyber Ninjas. The Senate\\'s attorney, Greg Jernigan, told CNN in an email that the state\\'s funding law doesn\\'t apply because the Senate, itself, is not accepting the private funds. Bennett, the state spokesman for the audit and a GOP politician who served as Arizona\\'s secretary of state from 2009 to 2015, said that the release of the total cost \"is really not the Senate\\'s responsibility.\" He said it\\'s up to Cyber Ninjas whether to disclose how much in funds it\\'s receiving and from where. So far, Cyber Ninjas has not done so, nor responded to CNN requests for that information. Bennett did say, \"we\\'re working on it.\"\"They are receiving money from opaque sources, and they are not disclosing that money,\" David Becker, a former voting-rights attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice and executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, said of the Senate. \"They can say it isn\\'t coming to the Arizona Senate, but they\\'re facilitating it; this would never have happened but for the Arizona Senate.\" Becker said it should be concerning that the Senate \"handed ballots over to an inexperienced out-of-state firm and then said, \\'fundraise off this, get as much money as you can.\\'\" The people ostensibly fundraising for the audit and/or saying they\\'ve made contributions include, at a minimum:The America Project, a non-profit run by Overstock founder Patrick Byrne, who met with Trump in the Oval Office in December to discuss tactics for overturning the election results, according to The Washington Post. The America Project claims on its fundraising website to have raised $1.6 million, with a goal of $2.8 million, for the audit. At a press conference on April 28, Bennett called on people to donate to the audit through the America Project\\'s website. Neither Byrne nor the America Project responded to repeated requests for interviews by CNN, nor to questions about whether it has forwarded donations and to whom. Voices and Votes, a website established by One America News personality Christina Bobb, who said on Twitter April 15 that she\\'d received two pledges totaling $150,000 to support the audit. Charles Herring, president of OAN\\'s parent company, told CNN that OAN hasn\\'t contributed to Voices and Votes and isn\\'t soliciting or receiving contributions. \"We are aware of efforts by staff members to raise funds for numerous causes from the Girl Scouts to audits,\" Herring said in an email. Neither Bobb nor Voices and Votes responded to CNN queries about whether it has forwarded donations for the audit, how much or to whom. L. Lin Wood, who, along with attorney Sidney Powell, filed numerous failed lawsuits on behalf of Trump baselessly claiming fraud in the 2020 election. In an April 7 post on Telegram, Wood said a nonprofit he leads was donating $50,000 to Bobb\\'s Voices and Votes group for the audit. Wood didn\\'t respond to CNN requests for an interview.  Mike Lindell, the MyPillow founder and a leading proponent of debunked election conspiracy theories. Lindell, in a phone interview, declined to say whether he\\'s contributed to the Arizona audit, and said he hasn\\'t been in touch with Cyber Ninjas or its CEO, Doug Logan. But asked if he\\'s encouraged others to donate to the audit, he said, \"One hundred percent, one thousand percent. I\\'ve done events where I spoke via Zoom and stuff, so yeah. I\\'ve been very much promoting.\"The state Senate could have put up more of its own funds or perhaps paid entirely for the audit. As first reported by the Arizona Mirror, thanks to spending far less during the pandemic, the Senate entered May with $8.1 million in unspent funds for the fiscal year that ends June 30. Doubts about transparencyJustice Department warns Arizona Senate president of civil rights violations in 2020 election auditIn an interview Wednesday, Bennett said the Senate\\'s purpose in relying on private funding for the audit is \"to save taxpayer money, not hide where the funding came from, but you and others may assume different.\" Bennett said that the sources of the funding don\\'t affect the work of the audit. By taking itself out of the process of accepting the funds, the Senate has bypassed the transparency requirement in the state\\'s public finance law, ARS Sec. 35-149, which requires it publicly identify the sources of money being used on government-sponsored projects. \"Obviously, the spirit of the statute is being violated,\" said Jim Barton, general counsel for the Arizona Democratic Party. \"The statute is about transparency and making sure that just what is happening right now doesn\\'t happen... when the money isn\\'t actually received by the government entity, but everyone knows, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, we\\'re going to give it to Cyber Ninjas to get the work done.\" Even before the audit began, critics questioned the choice of Cyber Ninjas, whose CEO, Doug Logan, repeatedly tweeted in support of the Stop the Steal movement and claimed the election had been rigged against Trump. Arizona Democrats sued over whether voter information, machines and ballots were being adequately protected; the news media sued to gain access to the audit, after initially being blocked from observing; Cyber Ninjas fought in court unsuccessfully to keep its audit processes secret. While Fann said the audit will improve future elections, the GOP-controlled Arizona legislature hasn\\'t waited for its outcome to move forward on bills making it harder to vote, including one signed into law by Gov. Doug Ducey May 11 that purged infrequent voters from permanent early voting lists.Becker, the voting-rights attorney, called the audit corrosive. \"It\\'s fueling the false beliefs of those who don\\'t believe the election was secure, and fueling the idea that elections are never truly over.\"On Thursday, Cyber Ninjas paused its review of ballots until May 24, temporarily removing them from the Coliseum at the state fairgrounds to make way for 16 high school graduations, a yearly event at the Coliseum that the Senate somehow overlooked. Bennett said the ballots would be kept under 24-hour guard at the Wesley Bolin Building at the south end of the fairground\\'s premises. Bennett said that guards would be posted to keep people visiting the fair\\'s Crazy Times Carnival, being held between the Coliseum and the Bolin Building, from accessing the area where the ballots were to be housed. They\\'re needed since the outside section of the building is being used for the carnival\\'s public toilets.  (CNN)Even though President Joe Biden has moved to reverse many of his predecessor\\'s anti-immigration policies, the consequences of those restrictive measures linger and have contributed to a massive backlog of nearly 2.6 million visa applications.The backlog includes nearly half a million applicants who are \"documentarily qualified\" and ready for interviews, according to a recent legal filing by the State Department. Backlogs in some immigrant-visa categories are 50 or even 100 times higher than they were four years ago, at the start of the Trump administration. Biden revokes Trump executive order sanctioning International Criminal Court officialsSome of the backlogs are due to restrictions imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But some also spring from pre-pandemic Trump policies or actions that the Biden administration hasn\\'t unwound. The Biden administration is still reviewing or hasn\\'t fully reversed some measures that slow or block processing, such as heightened background checks and questionable terrorism designations. In a policy reversal just Thursday, the State Department said that in places that are subject to regional pandemic travel restrictions, it will now let people seeking immigrant and fiancee visas go ahead and apply. Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined that \"it is in the national interest\" to exempt those applicants from the restrictions, a spokesman said.Read MoreThen, too, the effects of a Trump-era freeze on State Department hiring have left its consular sections short-staffed.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Biden has come under fire from Democrats for not, as of Friday, raising the refugee cap for this fiscal year to 62,500, as his administration proposed back in February. Biden also proposed a target cap of 125,000 for the fiscal year starting in October, up from Trump\\'s 2020 cap of 15,000, the lowest level ever.At a briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told CNN\\'s Kaitlan Collins that Biden remains committed to raising the cap to 62,500 by the end of the fiscal year, September 30, but she did not say when he\\'ll do so.Expect impact into next yearBiden has revoked immigration restrictions ranging from a travel ban targeting mostly Muslim-majority countries to, on April 1, reversing a policy under which certain asylum or immigration applications were rejected if the applicant had left any blank spaces on their forms.  But immigrants and asylum seekers are discovering that the effects of the obstacles the Trump administration erected are likely to continue choking the flow into the US of legal immigrants and asylum seekers well into next year.Leon Rodriguez, who served as director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2014 to 2017, said he thinks it will take the Biden administration \"a long time\" to return to or surpass pre-Trump levels of immigration and refugee admissions. \"I don\\'t think you\\'ve ever had ... as focused an effort on all fronts by the executive branch to reduce levels of immigration as you did from the Trump administration,\" he said.  Sarah Bahiraei, a US citizen, married Afshin Bahiraei, from Iran, in 2017. They have been living in Turkey with their daughter, Esther, while trying  to get a spousal visa for Afshin to emigrate to the US.Melanie Nezer, a senior vice president at HIAS, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid and assistance to refugees, put it this way: \"Picture a door like in New York City in the \\'70s, with a hundred locks. The Trump administration locked all those locks. The Biden administration has to find all those keys, unlock those locks, and they can\\'t open the door until all that is done.\" The State Department, in an email to CNN, said that \"backlog numbers will continue to fluctuate\" depending on pandemic conditions at various embassies and consulates, and on the rate at which Homeland Security and US Citizenship and Immigration Services \"approve additional petitions.\"Pandemic effectTo understand the challenges, consider the visa process. In March 2020, citing the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Department suspended routine visa services at embassies and consulates around the world. The next month, then-President Trump issued and twice extended a proclamation suspending the entry of most immigrants who didn\\'t already have valid visas until March 31, 2021. The State Department interpreted the bar on entry as also stopping it from issuing most immigrant visas, according to lawsuits against the agency. Although, by July, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began letting consulates and embassies reopen for limited visa operations at the discretion of their local chiefs of mission, most stayed closed for all but emergency services, State Department legal filings show. For security reasons, \"you can\\'t adjudicate visas or passports from home,\" said Michele Thoren Bond, a former State Department assistant secretary for consular affairs. \"Anything passport, anything visa-related, you have to be in the office to do it; and to initiate visa cases you have to bring the applicants into the embassy for interviews, too. Even if you reopen, you can\\'t let them come in the numbers that would have been normal, pre-Covid.\" In legal filings, the State Department said that because of illnesses and other issues, after Pompeo gave posts the option to reopen, that next month, August, more than two thirds of the 143 US consular posts didn\\'t schedule a single immigrant visa interview. Even by January, a third of consulates and embassies still were unable to schedule a single interview. A look at family-preference visas, which are issued to people seeking to join a relative already in the US, show how hard the pandemic restrictions hit a system already slowed by other Trump-administration moves.In February 2017, just after Trump took office, there was a backlog of 2,312 family-preference visa applications, according to Rebecca Austin, assistant director of the National Visa Center at the State Department. Each of the next three years, that backlog more than doubled and doubled again, reaching 26,737 by Feb. 8, 2020. Then, due to the pandemic closures, by February 8 of this year, the backlog leaped to nearly 285,000, she said in a declaration to a federal court in California. Visa interviews plummetDocuments filed in a visa lawsuit show that during the month of January 2020, before the pandemic, the State Department scheduled 22,856 family-preference visa interviews, worldwide. This past January, it scheduled 262 -- a drop of nearly 99%. Immigration attorneys in several visa lawsuits said the State Department continued to use temporary pandemic bans on entry from certain regions as a reason not to issue visas -- even though a federal judge told the State Department last September that plaintiffs seeking to overturn that policy \"are likely to succeed\" in their claim that it isn\\'t in accordance with law. The department reversed that policy for immigrant and fiancée visa applicants on Thursday. White House lifts Trump order that temporarily banned certain immigrant visas during pandemicIn a written response to queries from CNN, the State Department said that \"embassies and consulates are working to resume routine visa services on a location-by-location basis as expeditiously as possible in a safe manner,\" but that \"We do not expect to be able to safely return to pre-pandemic workload levels until mid-2021 at the earliest.\" Officials said health and safety measures would force them to \"prioritize the most urgent and mission-critical cases\" while scheduling fewer interviews than was normal before the pandemic. Efforts to get back to pre-pandemic visa levels face another obstacle: Last fall, Pompeo expanded a pandemic hiring freeze on consular officers, saying that with fewer people traveling to the US, the State Department wouldn\\'t need them. State Department officials declined CNN requests to discuss the extent of the consular shortfall; but in January, Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the department had about 1,000 fewer employees than it had at the start of the Trump administration. Because the Bureau of Consular Affairs relies mostly on visa and passport fees to fund its operations, the State Department said that the sharp drop in fee revenue from the pandemic \"will have continuing effects on our staffing and available resources for several years, which means even when post-specific conditions improve, many posts will not be able to immediately return to pre-pandemic workload levels.\"House and Senate Democrats have proposed a budget that would let the State Department hire about 1,200 new Foreign Service officers, including consular officers. But even if that budget is adopted, hiring and training new consular officers can take a year and a half or longer, especially for those learning challenging languages.\"It\\'s a very, very big hole,\" said Bond, the former assistant secretary for consular affairs. \"It is super challenging. You are not issuing library cards here, you have to examine every application, in many cases you have to interview the applicant ... there are checks that are being performed back in Washington; the whole interagency process, it is something that takes time.\"Lottery winners\\' worriesState Department visa delays particularly worried those waiting to get or use diversity visas -- up to 55,000 immigration visas a year that are awarded by lottery to qualified people from countries with low levels of immigration to the US. Winning a diversity visa is always a long shot; in fiscal 2018, for example, nearly 14.7 million people applied for the lottery, giving each one odds of 1 in 267 of being selected and then getting a visa. Diversity visa lottery winners from countries blocked by Trump hope for another chance under BidenBy law, diversity visas expire if they aren\\'t processed and issued in the same fiscal year. But as the pandemic closed US consular sections, the diversity-visa clock kept tickingAja Tamamu Mariama Kinteh, 33, a statistician from Banjul, capital of The Gambia, was thrilled when she won the visa lottery on her second try, in May 2019. (The diversity visa included her husband, a software designer, and their three children). She was offered a visa interview at the US embassy in neighboring Dakar, Senegal, on April 21, 2020, according to legal filings in a lawsuit against the State Department. But then the pandemic closure pushed her interview to August. And then the Trump administration extended the immigration ban through the end of 2020 -- far past the September 30 deadline for her to get her visa. \"I was devastated,\" she said in a court declaration. \"My whole family became heartbroken.\" They\\'d sold their car and other property to pay for their fees and travel costs. Kinteh eventually joined a visa lawsuit in the US and got a court-ordered interview in September. But it wasn\\'t until February 19, when the federal district court in Washington D.C. issued an emergency injunction preserving and extending the validity of most fiscal year 2020 diversity visas, that Kinteh could be sure she and her family could actually come to the US. They arrived in March, and are now in the state of Washington, her attorney said. On February 24, Biden revoked parts of the three presidential proclamations that had blocked entry of most immigrants. The next day, the State Department announced it would start processing immigrant visa applications again, and that it would reconsider cases of those who qualified for visas but had been denied because of the Trump-era proclamations. Iran\\'s compulsory military service But thousands of immigrant visa applicants from one country face yet another holdover obstacle.An April 2019 Trump presidential proclamation declared the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to be a terrorist organization. That proclamation -- which the Biden administration has not, so far, revisited -- bars anyone who\\'s served in the revolutionary guards from being granted a US visa. Iran makes military service compulsory for men; conscientious objection isn\\'t allowed. Men who don\\'t serve aren\\'t allowed to marry, to get passports, or to hold most jobs. Men have no choice in what military branch they\\'re assigned to -- including the revolutionary guards, said Paris Etemadi Scott, legal director of the Pars Equality Center, an immigration services non-profit based in San Jose, California.  Separated by the travel ban, these couples are taking to video to plead their case\"We\\'re on board with banning terrorists and keeping IRGC on the terrorist organization list, but not with keeping a husband from joining his spouse because 40 years ago he did mandatory service with IRGC, and by way they don\\'t get to choose,\" she said.Ehsan Orojlou, 36, and a civil engineer in Tehran who is currently waiting for his diversity visa, is one of those hoping the Biden administration will clarify the terrorist organization designation of the IRGC so that it won\\'t prevent issuing visas to those, like him, who served in the guards only because they had no choice. Orojlou said in a phone interview that he spent his obligatory military service typing letters and filing paperwork for the IRGC in Karaj, a suburb of Tehran, 14 years ago; and he said there are plenty of others like him. \"Most of us are engineers, doctors,\" he said. \"We have not killed a cockroach; how on earth can we be terrorists, I don\\'t know.\"  Sarah Vosseteig Bahiraei, a US citizen, was teaching in Turkey\\'s Cappadocia region when she fell in love with Afshin Bahiraei, a Christian refugee from Iran. They married in 2015; and, as CNN reported two years ago, their application for a spousal visa got caught up in Trump\\'s travel ban. Now, they have a daughter, Esther, born in Turkey -- and they\\'re still waiting, because Afshin Bahiraei, too, did his obligatory military service with the IRGC. He suspects that\\'s why his visa application remains in the limbo of administrative processing. The State Department declined to say whether it is re-examining who should fall under the bar on visas for members of the IRGC.Some face other obstacles. Because the US and Iran don\\'t have diplomatic relations, Iranians have to travel to a neighboring country to apply for a US visa. Negar Bayati, a legal permanent resident who moved to the US in 2016 on a diversity visa, said that her husband Pooria\\'s March 2020 spousal-visa interview, scheduled at the US embassy in Abu Dhabi, was canceled by the pandemic closure. Now the US embassy has started issuing visa appointments again -- but Abu Dhabi and the other emirates have their own pandemic travel bans from Iran and many other countries; and the US embassy there has turned down Bayati\\'s and her husband\\'s request to have the case moved to another US embassy in that region, she said. \"It\\'s a crazy situation,\" Bayati said. \"It\\'s been a horrible year for me. I thought my husband was going to be here last March.\"   (CNN)Federal authorities are looking into whether a 2018 trip to the Bahamas involving Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz and several young women was part of an orchestrated effort to illegally influence Gaetz in the area of medical marijuana, people briefed on the matter told CNN.   Prosecutors with the Justice Department\\'s Public Integrity Section are examining whether Gaetz took gifts, including travel and paid escorts, in exchange for political favors, the sources said.As part of an ongoing probe into Gaetz, investigators are examining whether he engaged in a relationship with a girl that began when she was 17. In pursuing evidence of potential public corruption, sources tell CNN that investigators are also scrutinizing Gaetz\\'s connections to medical marijuana, both in terms of legislation he\\'s sponsored and his connections to people involved in the industry, searching for so-called pay-to-play arrangements.  Gaetz has a long history of advocating for medical marijuana and has introduced several pieces of legislation seeking to loosen laws regulating the drug, both as a state representative in Florida and as a member of Congress. A number of his close associates have ties to the industry, including Jason Pirozzolo, a Florida doctor who founded a medical marijuana advocacy group and has in past news coverage in Florida been described as a \"marijuana investor.\" According to reports, Pirozzolo accompanied Gaetz on the 2018 trip to the Bahamas that investigators are scrutinizing.Neither Gaetz nor Pirozzolo has been accused by Justice Department officials of wrongdoing or charged with a crime. Read MoreCNN reported last week that Gaetz attended parties in the Orlando area with other prominent Republican officials involving young women, drugs and sex, according to two women in attendance. CNN has since learned that one of Gaetz\\'s associates, Joel Greenberg, a former county tax commissioner indicted last year on multiple federal charges, has been providing federal investigators with information about these parties and encounters he and Gaetz had with women who were given cash or gifts in exchange for sex.  Women detail drug use, sex and payments after late-night parties with Gaetz and others According to receipts reviewed by CNN, Gaetz and Greenberg used digital payment applications to send hundreds of dollars to at least one woman who attended the parties. Gaetz has denied ever paying for sex and over the past several weeks has sought to frame the allegations against him as the result of political bias in the justice system and the media.He has also accused investigators of twisting his generosity toward women into something criminal.\"Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you\\'re dating who are of legal age is not a crime,\" Gaetz said in an interview with Fox News late last month.A spokesman for Gaetz told CNN, \"Matt Gaetz is a long-time policy expert on the subject and passed legislation on the matter as far back as 2013. To suggest he needed anyone else nudging him along is risible.\"A lawyer representing Pirozzolo declined to comment.Details about the marijuana-related pay-to-play aspect of the probe provide a fresh perspective on the investigation, which has been conducted largely in secret since last year. Reports that federal agents seized Gaetz\\'s phone and that of a former girlfriend this winter are indicative of the seriousness of the government\\'s pursuit of evidence.  Friends from Florida Pirozzolo, an Orlando hand surgeon and amateur pilot, has over the last several years become a well-known figure at the Florida state Capitol in Tallahassee and an active advocate for medical marijuana in the state. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Pirozzolo has volunteered as \"doctor of the day\" for lawmakers and staffers at the state Capitol 30 times since 2011.  In this screengrab from video, Dr. Jason Pirozzolo from Orlando Hand Surgery Associates explains tennis elbow and provides exercises for rehabilitation. In 2018, Pirozzolo paid $50,000 to be listed as a chair of a reception for then-Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, according to an ad for the event. He contributed to Gaetz\\'s congressional campaign as well, though more modestly. Records show Pirozzolo made a pair of $1,000 contributions to Gaetz in 2016 and 2017. The connection between Gaetz and Pirozzolo goes back years. In Gaetz\\'s 2020 book, \"Firebrand,\" he referred to Pirozzolo as one of \"my best friends.\" Pirozzolo\\'s access to the congressman is on display in a 2018 video viewed by CNN in which he is seen landing a helicopter near his sprawling home in a suburb of Orlando and Gaetz emerges as his passenger. The two men are greeted warmly by several women, one of whom hugs Gaetz. In 2014, Gaetz, then a state representative in Florida, introduced medical marijuana legislation. The bill, a version of which eventually became law, allowed Florida residents and doctors access to a non-euphoric strain of marijuana that is designed to help alleviate symptoms like seizures. It can also be used to treat patients suffering from ailments like cancer or Lou Gehrig\\'s disease.   One week after the legislation passed, Pirozzolo launched a medical marijuana consulting company, as first reported by the Orlando Sentinel.   Two years later, in 2016, Pirozzolo co-founded an advocacy group called the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association. The group says it is devoted to educating doctors about medicinal marijuana and expanding research into its safe use, including as a pain management alternative to opioids.   Gaetz has attended or spoken at AMMPA events at least two times in recent years, according to social media postings and an interview with a former member of the group. He also honored the AMMPA\\'s board of directors from the House floor in 2018 as being \"instrumental\" in raising awareness of medical marijuana as a valid treatment option.  Gaetz goes to WashingtonShortly after arriving in Washington in 2017, Gaetz began introducing medical marijuana-related legislation, though none was ultimately successful. In April of that year he proposed a law to classify marijuana as a schedule III controlled substance, which would ease federal marijuana restrictions related to medical prescriptions and research.  Rep. Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, questions witnesses at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the impeachment of President Donald Trump, December 4, 2019.  A year later, in April 2018, Gaetz introduced the Medical Cannabis Research Act, a bill designed to establish a new, separate registration process for manufacturers of cannabis for research.   Before introducing it, Gaetz hand-delivered a fully written draft of the bill to his staff, a source told CNN, suggesting that Gaetz\\'s staff did not play a role in crafting it. The legislation overlapped significantly with the agenda Pirozzolo\\'s group had been pushing to ease federal limitations on research involving medical marijuana. Three months after Gaetz introduced the bill, Pirozzolo appeared on a podcast called Ganjapreneur to talk about the need to lift restrictions on medical research of marijuana. He singled out Gaetz for his efforts in Congress.  \"Congressman Matt Gaetz is in the process of working on legislation up in Washington, D.C., that will help facilitate research on a nationwide level,\" he told listeners.  In 2019, Gaetz reintroduced his bill in the House and put out a news release echoing some of the same points Pirozzolo had made on the podcast. The House approved by voice vote a different bill expanding medical marijuana research from Rep. Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat, in December. Gaetz was a co-sponsor.   The congressman, the doctor and a former modelOne person summoned to testify by federal prosecutors in Florida last summer has connections to Gaetz, Pirozzolo and Greenberg. Megan Zalonka, a former model and friend of Gaetz, simultaneously worked for both Pirozzolo and Greenberg, the indicted former tax commissioner who is currently in jail. Zalonka was subpoenaed to testify in August by the same prosecutor who had indicted Greenberg two months earlier, records show. There is no indication the subpoena was related to Gaetz. In 2018, Zalonka began working as the director of communications for Pirozollo\\'s AMMPA group. At the same time, she was contracting to provide public relations services at the Seminole County Tax Collector\\'s office run by Greenberg.  A subsequent review questioned $7,000 in payments to Zalonka\\'s company by Greenberg. An audit performed by a private firm for the Seminole County tax collector\\'s office last year included the payments in a list of \"questioned or unaccounted for purchases.\"  A spokesperson for the tax collector\\'s office said the office has no record of any work the company, MZ Strategy, did for Greenberg. Zalonka played a highly visible role with AMMPA, often appearing in photos at the group\\'s events, including one with Gaetz. Zalonka had a personal connection to the congressman as well. Gaetz took Zalonka as a date to multiple political functions in Florida dating back to at least 2019, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two also traded Instagram messages about a get-together involving Zalonka, a male companion and Gaetz and his fiancée and plans to do it again. In the helicopter video viewed by CNN, Zalonka is among the women who greet Gaetz and Pirozzolo.Zalonka has not been accused of wrongdoing. Multiple attempts by CNN to reach her via phone calls, texting and in-person visits to addresses linked to her were unsuccessful.  Another person whose association with Gaetz and his circle of friends is under scrutiny by investigators is Chris Dorworth, a former Florida state representative. \\'He\\'s not a team player\\': Republicans steer clear of Gaetz amid DOJ investigation Earlier this month, Dorworth resigned from a prominent lobbying firm after The New York Times reported his name had come up in the Gaetz probe in connection with an alleged scheme to run a so-called ghost candidate in a local election.  Dorworth has denied any wrongdoing and previously told CNN he did not recall talking with Gaetz about running a third candidate and pointed out that he didn\\'t believe it would have been illegal if it did occur. Before resigning, Dorworth was a registered lobbyist for various clients including a Florida-based cannabis company that opened its first dispensary after the Florida Legislature passed the Gaetz-sponsored marijuana bill in 2014.  According to multiple people familiar with the matter, Dorworth attended some of the parties where Gaetz was present. Dorworth did not respond to a request to comment on his attendance at those parties. He has not been charged with any crime.A hazy financial pictureIt\\'s unclear what, if anything, Pirozzolo stands to gain financially from loosened marijuana laws. He has been described in past news coverage in Florida as a \"marijuana investor.\" But there is scant publicly available information detailing his precise financial stake in the industry. Records show that in 2018, a business Pirozzolo formed with a fellow doctor acquired a stake, then valued at $2.1 million, in a Miami-based medical marijuana company called Cansortium Holdings. It is unclear what became of his investment. Additionally, Pirozzolo formed two companies linked to the AMMPA group, according to filings with the Florida secretary of state. A former business partner told CNN that Pirozzolo also has a consulting firm that helps marijuana-related businesses acquire licenses from the state. On the Ganjapreneur podcast, Pirozzolo told host TG Branfalt he saw AMMPA as being on the forefront of medical marijuana advocacy.  \"We\\'re going to put together some evidence and research and see if we can safely move this industry forward,\" Pirozzolo said.   He pointed out that Florida law places restrictions on doctors from benefiting financially from referrals to medical marijuana dispensaries or from ownership stakes in the supply side of the business.  \"One way to mitigate the risk here in the state of Florida is to avoid any situation that would even result in any perception of impropriety,\" Pirozzolo said.  This story has been updated to include a comment from a spokesman for Gaetz.CNN\\'s Curt Devine, Ryan Nobles and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.  (CNN)In the months after George Floyd\\'s death, Minneapolis Police Department officers reported using force on far fewer people -- but then use of force spiked late last year, a CNN analysis of department data found.And after Floyd\\'s death, Black people are still subject to use of force by Minneapolis officers at a highly disproportionate rate.RELATED: How Minneapolis Police first described the murder of George Floyd, and what we know nowThe analysis, which comes as the Justice Department announced Wednesday it would open an investigation into the MPD\\'s practices, suggests that the prosecution of former officer Derek Chauvin in Floyd\\'s death hasn\\'t led to a sustained reduction in use of force by Minneapolis officers -- or the racial disparities in who is subject to police force.Justice Department to investigate Minneapolis policing practices after George Floyd\\'s deathCNN reviewed cases in which the race of the person police used force on was recorded. Between January 2008, when the data begins, and May 25, 2020, when Chauvin killed Floyd, 64.6% of people who police used force on were Black. Since Floyd\\'s death, 62.6% were Black. Read MoreThat\\'s in a city that is just 19% Black, according to US Census records. According to the latest version of MPD\\'s policy manual, use of force is defined as intentional \"bodily contact that causes pain or injury or restricts someone\\'s movement,\" or threatening that conduct. It includes the use of a weapon, physical strikes, or displaying a weapon while interacting with a suspect.  The most common type of force officers reported using both before and after Floyd\\'s death was a \"body weight pin.\" Other commonly used types of force include joint locks, punches, takedowns, and personal mace. Overall, the MPD data shows that police use of force dropped significantly immediately after Floyd\\'s killing last May. Officers reported using force on 32 people in June and 31 people in July -- the lowest totals of any month since the beginning of the data in 2008. But later in 2020, there was a pronounced spike. Officers used force on 204 people in September, 232 in October and 221 in November -- the highest monthly totals in the dataset. Since then, use of force has dropped, but is still elevated compared to previous years. Police used force on 115 people in March 2021 -- more than any month in 2017, 2018 or 2019. The data does not include officer-involved shootings, which are reported separately.MPD has not responded to CNN\\'s request for comment.How Minneapolis Police first described the murder of George Floyd, and what we know nowPolice reported using a \"neck restraint\" in only a single case since Floyd\\'s killing, in which Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\\'s neck. An officer put a 26-year-old Black man arrested for burglary in a neck restraint in August 2020, according to the data. The man was listed as assaulting an officer. The city banned all neck restraints and chokeholds by police in June.CNN reported last year that Minneapolis police reported using neck restraints on hundreds of people in the years before Floyd\\'s death, two-thirds of whom were Black. Chauvin\\'s use of force on Floyd does not appear to be listed in the dataset -- there are no recorded uses of force on May 25, 2020.In addition, officers appear to be recording less complete data about the race of the people they used force on. Since Floyd\\'s death, 19% of people who officers used force on were listed with an \"unknown\" or \"not recorded\" race, compared to less than 4% in the years before his death. It\\'s possible that that discrepancy could be because some of the more recent cases are still being investigated.   (CNN)Black Georgians disproportionately cast their ballots on the weekend days that Republican lawmakers want to eliminate as options in future elections, according to a CNN analysis of voting data from last November\\'s general election.A measure moving swiftly through the Georgia legislature would reduce the number of weekend days available for in-person early voting and ban casting ballots on the final Sunday of the early voting period. Voting rights activists say the move attacks the \"Souls to the Polls\" programs that help drive turnout among Black churchgoers, a key Democratic constituency.More on Voting RightsAnalysis: Why Republican voter restrictions are a race against time\\'Cologne on Jim Crow\\': Georgia GOP drives toward new restrictionsAt least 45 states have seen bills aimed at voter suppression. Here\\'s whyMichelle Obama, celebrities urge Americans to support voting rights billOnly 26.9% of the voters who cast in-person early ballots in Georgia during the general election were Black, state voting records showed. But CNN\\'s analysis shows Black voters made up 34.6% of the voters who cast early ballots on the three weekend voting days that could be eliminated under the proposal from Georgia lawmakers -- about 48,000 people, significantly more than President Joe Biden\\'s victory over former President Donald Trump in the state. Biden won Georgia by just shy of 12,000 votes.Georgia sits at the epicenter of a nationwide battle over voting rights -- following repeated and baseless claims by Trump that he lost the White House last fall because of fraud. Around the country, Republican-controlled state legislatures now are relying on election falsehoods to mount aggressive changes to voting rules. As of February 19, lawmakers in more than 40 states had introduced more than 250 bills that included voting restrictions, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center of Justice at New York University, which is tracking the bills.\\n\\nGeorgia stands out for expansive Republican efforts to erect new barriers to voting, after the GOP lost the presidential election and two Senate contests. The Democratic victories in the state helped send Biden to the White House and gave Democrats a narrow majority in the US Senate.Read MoreA sweeping package of new election rules that recently passed the Georgia House would -- in addition to reducing the number of weekend days for early voting -- restrict absentee voting, end automatic voter registration and limit access to drop boxes that voters use to return their absentee ballots.The bill has moved to the Georgia Senate, which is weighing its own list of new restrictions -- including ending no-excuse absentee voting.Cliff Albright of the Georgia-based Black Voters Matter Fund called his state \"the voter suppression capital of the country.\"\"The breadth of this attack and the speed with which it\\'s coming is unlike anything we\\'ve seen since Jim Crow,\" Albright told CNN this week.Georgia Rep. Barry Fleming, the primary author of the package that passed the Georgia House, declined to comment for this story. But Fleming, who chairs a special House committee on elections, has said the provisions would address voter perceptions that they couldn\\'t trust Georgia\\'s election results.\"The challenge for the legislature is to see what kind of changes we can make in our election system to try to increase that public confidence,\" Fleming said during a recent online discussion organized by the Georgia First Amendment Foundation. \"Because if one thing we probably know, going forward in Georgia, we\\'re going to have close elections.\"Black early votingIn the voting package passed this week, Republican lawmakers in the Georgia House retreated from an initial plan to ban Sunday voting entirely, amid public outcry. But the measure still cuts down on weekend voting.Under current law, local registrars in Georgia are allowed to offer in-person early voting on any of the four weekend days during the state\\'s nearly three-week early voting period. The bill that passed the Georgia House this week would restrict that, only allowing early voting on two weekend days: either the first Saturday or Sunday of the early voting period -- a decision left up to the registrar -- as well as the second Saturday.In the leadup to the 2020 general election, roughly 138,000 voters cast in-person early ballots on the three days of early voting that could have possibly been eliminated had the new bill been in effect -- the first Saturday and Sunday of the early voting period, October 17 and October 18, and the final Sunday of early voting, October 25.Those days saw disproportionately high rates of Black and minority turnout as compared to other early voting days, according to absentee voting records published by the Secretary of State\\'s office. More broadly, White Georgians were less likely to vote on weekends than those from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Only 8.6% of White voters who cast early in-person ballots did so on a weekend, compared with nearly 12% of Black and Latino voters and almost 15% of Asian voters. The CNN analysis used a copy of the Georgia voter file that includes voters\\' race, which was provided by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies elections. Georgians self-report their race and ethnicity when they register to vote. Racial and ethnic data were not available for about 7% of voters who cast early in-person ballots in the 2020 general election.Shawanda Williams, a hospital administrator who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, cast her ballot on the last Sunday of the early voting period -- a day that the House bill would exclude from early voting in future elections. In an interview with CNN, Williams said she appreciated the opportunity to cast her vote that day because she usually got home from work after her local early voting site had closed.On the last Sunday of early voting, she said, \"Football was on, I figured nobody\\'s going to be there -- and I was able to run in and out.\"Without the opportunity to vote that day, Williams, who supported Biden, said she would have made time to cast her ballot -- but it would have been a much bigger hassle. \"It does seem like they\\'re trying to change the rules to make it harder for people to vote,\" she said. \"It\\'s like voter suppression.\"Having multiple weekend voting options is particularly important for working-class Georgians, said Atlanta City Councilman Antonio Brown, who founded a social-justice group, The People\\'s Uprising.\"Most working families are working two or three jobs, and don\\'t have the capacity to be able to vote, like a normal person working a normal job where the hours of that job kind of coincide with their ability to go into a voting precinct and actually cast the ballot,\" Brown said. And across Georgia, Black churchgoers have a tradition of heading to the polls together after Sunday services -- driving to the polls or riding in church vans to cast their ballots during the early voting period.Bishop Victor Powell is active in voting rights as pastor of the Rhema Word Cathedral in Albany, Georgia -- in the heart of the state\\'s rural \"Black Belt.\"He said the \"Souls to the Polls\" push on the final Sunday of early voting offers convenience. \"You\\'ve got a ready-made audience that you can talk to and say, \\'Before you go to dinner, go to the polls.\\' \"But Powell said he\\'s always encouraged his congregation and the broader community to use every available path to the franchise.  \"We don\\'t wait until the last day\" to vote, he said. \"Anything can happen.\"Falsehoods persistGeorgia\\'s push to restrict paths to voting comes as Republicans around the country -- led by Trump -- continue to promote the falsehood of election fraud. Speaking to activists over the weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump repeatedly made false claims about the election and called for more restrictions, including proof of citizenship to cast a ballot and limits on mail-in voting.This week, former Vice President Mike Pence joined the criticism, taking aim at a Democratic bill that passed in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday that would set uniform standards for voting. The bill, dubbed The For the People Act, would deliver the biggest overhaul to US election law in decades. Among other provisions, it would mandate automatic voter registration, expand mail-in voting and restore voting rights to former felons. In an op-ed in The Daily Signal, Pence claimed the 2020 election was \"marked by significant voting irregularities\" and described the work under way in state legislatures as needed \"reform to restore public confidence in state elections.\"There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would have changed the outcome of the 2020 election.Allegations of voter fraud are \"just code for historic Black turnout,\" said Sherrell Byrd, who helps run SOWEGA Rising, a community organization in southwest Georgia.\"That\\'s what\\'s being attacked right now,\" she said. \"The things we fought for. That our grandparents were fighting for. They said, \\'Fine, we\\'ll give you those rights.\\' We exercised those rights. We did what we were supposed to do, and it worked.\"\"So, they continue to try to change the game,\" Byrd said of Georgia lawmakers.Black voters in Georgia helped propel Democrats to big wins. Exit polls show 88% of the Black electorate supported Biden last November. And in January, Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock saw even bigger support, capturing 92% and 93% of the Black vote in their runoff elections, respectively.Warnock, who won a special election, is on the ballot again in November 2022.Faced with the barrage of bills moving through the Georgia legislature, activists are turning to other forms of public pressure.This week, Black Voters Matters Fund launched an advertising effort with other voting-rights groups that calls on corporations in Georgia to speak out against the voting restrictions. And this weekend, the NBA is teaming with a group founded by Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James to promote voting rights during Sunday\\'s All-Star Game in Atlanta.Powell, the pastor from Albany, said he\\'s hopeful that Black voters in the state and elsewhere won\\'t retreat, even if Georgia\\'s proposed voting restrictions become law.  \"An awakening has taken place, not only in places like Georgia, but in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,\" Powell said, ticking off battleground states that saw strong Black voter turnout last year. \"People will find a way because they witnessed what happens when we get engaged and come together.\"  (CNN)A former Florida state senator who resigned in disgrace four years ago was charged Thursday with campaign finance violations related to a hotly contested state Senate race in the 2020 election, authorities said.Frank Artiles, 47, turned himself in to authorities in Miami one day after his home was searched by investigators with the Miami-Dade State Attorney\\'s Office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe county\\'s top prosecutor, Katherine Fernandez Rundle, accused Artiles at a news conference on Thursday afternoon of paying an old friend almost $45,000 to mount a fake candidacy intended to illegally sway the election.Artiles, a Republican operative with a reputation for a foul mouth and sharp elbows, is accused of financing a sham candidate whose candidacy was intended to siphon votes from a legitimate Democratic candidate in a state Senate race in South Florida\\'s 37th District.

A spokeswoman for Garcia said the newly elected senator had never met Artiles.In a text to a CNN reporter shortly before Artiles surrendered, his defense attorney, Greg Chonillo, said his client \"has been cooperative since the inception of this investigation as well as during the execution of the search warrant. Due to the nature of the charges and potential litigation, we will not comment on any information related to this matter. We fully intend to defend any charges in Court.\"A dark money mystery in Florida centers on the campaign of a spoiler candidate who appeared to help a Republican win by 32 votesAttorney William Barzee, who represents candidate Rodriguez, told CNN: \"Frank Artiles and his co-conspirators knew they couldn\\'t beat Jose Javier Rodriguez in a fair election so they rigged it. Artiles cynically targeted and used a vulnerable \\'friend\\' with a great name to run in the race in order to confuse voters and steal the election. Alex Rodriguez deeply regrets allowing himself to be used in this way and hopes that by coming forth with the truth he can help to right these wrongs.\"Rodriguez was also taken into custody in connection with the case, a corrections official in Miami-Dade County told CNN.Questions began swirling last year in Florida media and political circles about the 37th District election, as CNN reported in November.Even before his arrest, Artiles was a controversial figure in Florida politics.According to the Miami Herald, in 2014 he was secretly recorded referring to Muslims as \"hajis,\" and then later, in 2017, he used the n-word and other derogatory language while speaking to Black Florida senators.Artiles later apologized for the remarks, the first of two incidents that ultimately forced him to step down as state senator.

(CNN)An Oath Keeper who appeared to be providing security for political operative Roger Stone on January 6 later joined an angry mob outside the Capitol, according to video and images reviewed by CNN and four sources who confirmed his identity.Hours after being seen with Stone outside a Washington hotel, Roberto Minuta was photographed on steps at the eastern side of the Capitol wearing goggles and other equipment. Video shows Minuta pointing and yelling at police next to other individuals wearing logos associated with the Oath Keepers, an anti-government, far-right militant group.Two videos show a man wearing goggles and clothing identical to that of Minuta inside the Capitol during the riots.Roberto Minuta and others flank political operative Roger Stone on the morning of January 6th.Someone who answered the phone at Minuta\\'s tattoo shop declined to comment to CNN and hung up. Minuta\\'s wife told ABC News that Minuta had not entered the Capitol, but she confirmed he was \"another patriot\" outside the building \"standing up for freedom.\" Minuta has not been charged with a crime. Before the Capitol incident, Minuta flanked Stone outside a hotel, as shown in a video first reported by ABC News. He and other men appeared to be serving as bodyguards as Stone greeted his supporters and took pictures with them.  Read MoreMinuta had also walked alongside former national security adviser Michael Flynn at a rally in Washington on December 12 and was interviewed by Alex Jones for his InfoWars program in a video posted on January 19, 2020, before a gun-rights rally in Virginia.Minuta has previously received support from the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes.Last May, when Minuta decided to reopen the tattoo parlor he runs in Newburgh, New York, in defiance of the governor\\'s Covid-19-related order to close nonessential businesses, Rhodes called on all Oath Keepers members within driving distance to attend a rally at Minuta\\'s shop. \"Anytime a patriot stands up in defense of liberty, we need to be standing right there with him, shoulder-to-shoulder,\" Rhodes said in a statement about the planned rally posted on the Oath Keepers website.Alleged Oath Keeper charged in Capitol riot says he once worked for FBI and holds security clearanceStone did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment about Minuta but has said on Telegram that he had nothing to do with the Capitol riot because he wasn\\'t there and knew nothing about it in advance. Sidney Powell, an attorney for Flynn, whose appearance close to Minuta in Washington was previously reported by the Daily Beast, said Flynn does not know Minuta and \"could not pick him out of a lineup.\"  The Oath Keepers, who generally believe that former military and police can defend the Constitution as a self-styled militia against parts of the government that they view as corrupt, have come under scrutiny for activity related to the Capitol incident. A statement posted on the group\\'s website on January 4 said, \"All Patriots who can get to DC need to be in DC. Now is the time to stand.\" The post said members would provide security for speakers and attendees at events on January 5 and 6. Roberto Minuta protests outside the US Capitol on January 6th.The Justice Department has indicted three individuals in connection with the Capitol riot who are allegedly affiliated with the Oath Keepers. One of them, Thomas Caldwell of Virginia, said in a court filing Monday that he previously worked for the FBI and has held a \"Top Secret\"-level security clearance for decades.Prosecutors have called Caldwell an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers but Oath Keepers leader Rhodes previously denied that to CNN. Caldwell\\'s defense attorney denied in a court filing that Caldwell is an Oath Keeper and argued that prosecutors have no proof he was inside the Capitol on January 6.Rhodes did not respond to CNN\\'s questions about Minuta. \"It\\'s deeply troubling that a group which already has some conspiracy indictments for what happened at the Capitol was also pulling security for Roger Stone just that morning,\" said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto\\'s Citizen Lab who has worked with others to identify individuals who participated in the Capitol riots. Roberto Minuta, on right with goggles,  joins demonstrators on the steps of the eastern side of the US Capitol.Scott-Railton said he believes there\\'s more to learn about the scope of Oath Keepers members\\' activity surrounding the Capitol incidents.The videos of Minuta were first analyzed by volunteers including Scott-Railton and a research group called the Capitol Terrorists Exposers.On a podcast in May, Minuta explained his decision to reopen his tattoo shop despite the governor\\'s order to remain closed.\"I\\'ve been watching the erosion of our rights on so many different levels that at what point do you draw that line in the sand, you know?\" he said.CNN\\'s Ben Naughton contributed to this report.  (CNN)As the Trump faithful gathered around the Capitol on January 6, two conspiracy theories peddling in government mistrust converged: The fraudulent belief that the election was stolen, and the dangerous narrative that Covid-19 vaccinations are wildly unsafe. \"We\\'re being led off of a cliff,\" Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist, told the crowd at the \"MAGA Freedom Rally D.C.\" about a block from the Capitol.\"I wish I could tell you that Tony Fauci cares about your safety...\" he said. \"I wish I could believe that voting machines worked... but none of this is happening.\"In the wake of Trump\\'s electoral defeat, some leaders of the anti-vaccine movement latched onto the \"Stop the Steal\" crusade, advancing their own conspiratorial claims and, in some cases, promoting private business ventures, CNN has found. Some prominent anti-vaxxers say they directly coordinated with organizers of the DC rallies in January and pushed their message at other MAGA demonstrations, and on pro-Trump podcasts and social media platforms.The anti-vaccine message may have found a particularly receptive audience among some fervent Trump supporters, many of whom flout wearing masks and contend the lethality of the virus is overblown. Read More\"It\\'s marketing at a basic sales level,\" said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has analyzed the strategies of anti-vaccine advocates. \"Conspiracism that allows you to connect anything together if you want to, because it doesn\\'t require fact.\"Contrary to the statements of vaccine critics, the two vaccines authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration have been shown to be safe and effective. But public health experts warn that anti-vaccine messages now pose a unique threat to the nation\\'s health given the urgency for widespread coronavirus vaccination.  \"One of our big concerns is that because people are seeing this anti-vaccine rhetoric we may not be able to reach levels of herd immunity we really need to stop virus proliferation,\" Tara C. Smith, an epidemiology professor at Kent State University, told CNN. A national poll published this week from Monmouth University found 24% of people in the US will avoid getting the coronavirus vaccine if they can help it. The poll also found that willingness is driven more by political leanings than demographics. The rally at the US Capitol featuring Bigtree, advertised as \"The MAGA Health Freedom Event of the Century,\" included other notable vaccine conspiracy theorists such as Mikki Willis, the filmmaker behind \"Plandemic,\" which falsely suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was responsible for the creation of the coronavirus.Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist, speaks at \"MAGA Freedom Rally\" on January 6, 2021.Bigtree, who says he\\'s \"not anti-vaccine\" but rather \"pro-science\" and neither a Republican nor a Democrat, told CNN he did not speak at the rally to promote or benefit from \"Stop The Steal\" but rather to share his own message. \"Wherever there is an audience, I want to get the message across that our bodies are ours. We should be in control of what\\'s injected into them,\" he said. The event was organized in part by a political action committee run by Ty and Charlene Bollinger, a married couple who run websites and sell documentaries that claim to reveal \"the truth about vaccines\" and range in price from $199 to $499. They also market alternative health books and other products.The Bollingers have engaged for years in what they describe as health-freedom activism. But in recent months they took up another cause.In early November, they co-authored a post about \"voter fraud and election meddling\" for the website of political operative Roger Stone, who has taken credit for coining the phrase \"Stop the Steal\" to help then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. Last November, Stone wrote in a webpost that he \"strategized\" with the Bollingers.Blending conspiracy theoriesOn November 21, the Bollingers spoke at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Nashville and blended election conspiracy theories with claims that then President-elect Joe Biden planned to force vaccinations.\"There is no pandemic. It\\'s all BS,\" Ty Bollinger told onlookers.Ty and Charlene Bollinger sell documentaries that claim to reveal the \"truth about vaccines.\"In a video posted on January 4, Charlene Bollinger said she was working with other organizers on plans for the January 6th protests including \"Ali\" -- an apparent reference to Ali Alexander, a leader of the broader \"Stop the Steal\" movement.Two days later, Charlene Bollinger introduced the speakers at her group\\'s rally near the US Capitol, plugged her documentaries and blasted what she called, \"the forced Covid vaccine, such a scam.\" She also told attendees that her husband Ty wasn\\'t with her because he had gone to join the siege. \"I told him... they are storming the Capitol, and he looked at me and said, \\'Do I need to stay here?\\' I knew he wanted to go. I said, \\'Honey go,\\' so he did,\" she said.Charlene Bollinger added that Ty texted her and said he was \"outside\" the Capitol. She then prayed \"for the patriots that are there now inside. They\\'re trying to get inside that Capitol. Lord, use these people to eradicate this evil, these swamp creatures.\"The Bollingers did not respond to CNN\\'s phone calls and emails that requested comment.While outlandish claims of a stolen election may appear disjointed with vaccine fearmongering, their union at recent political rallies does not surprise Ahmed, of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.Ahmed said fulltime anti-vaccine advocates often search for new audiences within other fringe movements with which they can build alliances. And he said it\\'s not a coincidence that some of these professionals sell products like health supplements. A July report by Ahmed\\'s organization CCDH unpacked what it described as the \"Anti-Vaxx Industry.\" The report noted that fulltime anti-vaccine campaigners expand their reach by appearing on conspiracy-theory-based YouTube channels and also lend their audiences to anti-vaccine entrepreneurs who seek to sell them products. \"What you\\'re talking about is old fashioned snake-oil salesmen,\" Ahmed said.Alex Jones and InfoWarsAnother promoter of the stolen-election conspiracy theory is Alex Jones, who has long peddled falsehoods about vaccines and mainstream medicines on his show InfoWars. The show frequently advertises Jones\\' dietary supplements and survival products.In April, the FDA warned Jones to take down a number of products marketed on his site as possible coronavirus treatments, such as \"Superblue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.\" Those products no longer appear on his site.Jones, who previously said a \"form of psychosis\" made him believe events like the Sandy Hook massacre were staged, has continued to promote other supplements next to segments on his show that stoke fears about coronavirus vaccines.  In recent months, he has woven in false allegations of widespread election meddling.On January 3, Jones referenced \"pure evidence of election fraud\" just before a \"news\" alert about \"forced inoculations\" and other coronavirus claims. The video remains online next to an ad for \"DNA Force Plus\" supplements. The InfoWars Store includes a disclaimer that the products are \"not intended for use in the cure, treatment, prevention or mitigation of any disease...\"Jones also traveled to Washington and spoke at a pro-Trump rally on the eve of the Capitol siege. There, he blasted what he falsely described as the \"engineered virus that Bill Gates owns.\"InfoWars did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment.Spreading theories on social mediaOther vaccine skeptics have promoted election conspiracy theories on social media. Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a physician, supplement salesperson and author of the books such as \"Saying No To Vaccines,\" repeatedly promoted the January 6 Washington protests on Telegram. A January 5 post, for example, included a \"call to action\" and quoted the founder of the Oath Keepers extremist militant group as saying, \"Get to DC and STAND!\" Those posts were interspersed among her more usual anti-vaccine content.Tenpenny also shared the \"Stop the Steal\" hashtag on Twitter in a quote tweet of a post about the DC rally from Dr. Simone Gold.Gold, who founded the group America\\'s Frontline Doctors, made headlines last summer for her appearance in a video that was later removed from social media for coronavirus misinformation. Trump retweeted the video, which also featured Stella Immanuel, who said in the past that DNA from space aliens is used in medicine.Dr. Simone Gold speaks at pro-Trump rally on January 5, 2021.On January 5, \"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander introduced Gold at a Washington rally and reminded attendees that they weren\\'t just fighting for the election but also against \"medical tyranny.\"Gold then took the stage and told the crowd, \"If you don\\'t want to take an experimental biological agent deceptively named a vaccine, you must not allow yourself to be coerced!\"The next day, Gold and her colleague entered the Capitol building during the siege, according to an affidavit for a criminal complaint against her. She was later arrested, according to the Department of Justice.America\\'s Frontline Doctors told CNN in a statement that Gold is not a political organizer and \"did not participate in any incident that involved violence or vandalism and has categorically rebuked any such activity\" by others. The statement added that America\\'s Frontline Doctors\\' physicians have recommended vaccines to patients but said the organization believes \"more study and greater transparency are needed with respect to COVID-19 vaccines.\"Since the riot, she has continued to spread her message. \"Definitely you should not be calling this the Covid-19 vaccines. The reason is, whatever you call it, it\\'s experimental. It\\'s not been approved as a vaccine,\" Gold said in a video posted January 14 that showed a talk she gave at a Tampa, Florida-based church led by a pastor who has appeared on Alex Jones\\' show. Alex Jones, the founder of right-wing media group Infowars, addresses a crowd of pro-Trump protesters after they storm the grounds of the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.While some audiences may have concerns after hearing anti-vaccine messages that reference actual instances of allergic reactions or other anecdotes, context is key, says Smith of Kent State University. \"You\\'ve had a handful of allergic reactions as compared to 4,000 people dying a day from actual coronavirus infection,\" she said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that severe allergic reactions to Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech\\'s vaccines are rare.  Smith said that when anti-vaccine activists\\' claims about coronavirus vaccines are put in the larger context of scientific literature, \"all of those concerns are just dwarfed.\" While the momentum of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement may have died down, vaccine skeptics and far-right political groups will likely continue to trade audiences and ideas, which could translate into more public demonstrations, says Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights.Burghart, who tracks far-right groups, said he has watched these two movements develop an increasing symbiotic relationship during the coronavirus pandemic. \"There is a larger constituency that is mobilized and they have adopted a far more destructive view of vaccines than they had before, and they have united with far-right paramilitaries and others,\" he said.  CNN\\'s Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Benjamin Naughton and Scott Bronstein contributed to this report.   (CNN)After the deadly sacking of the US Capitol this month, President Donald Trump\\'s reelection campaign has insisted it had nothing to do with the National Mall rally that preceded the riot and featured a speech from the President.But many of the individuals who helped put on the bombastic rally that day had worked to stage other Trump rallies just a few months earlier. Ten of the 12 people listed as onsite emergency contacts on the government permit approving the January 6 rally have previously worked for or been paid by Trump\\'s reelection campaign, according to a CNN review of Federal Election Commission records, and several worked in the Trump White House. The rally, billed as a \"March for Trump,\" was organized by Women for America First, a conservative nonprofit group founded by a longtime Tea Party activist. The National Park Service approved a permit for an event that the group predicted would attract 30,000 people to The Ellipse on January 6, the day Congress certified Trump\\'s electoral defeat to President-elect Joe Biden. Later that day, a mob of Trump supporters -- some of whom had attended the rally -- stormed the Capitol, killing a police officer and leaving four others dead in the mayhem.JUST WATCHED\\'Stop the Steal\\' organizer says GOP lawmakers helped himReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\\'Stop the Steal\\' organizer says GOP lawmakers helped him 02:11Trump spoke at the rally, encouraging his supporters to \"fight like hell\" and airing debunked conspiracy theories about the election.

Read MoreThe permit shows that numerous former Trump campaign staffers were also involved in running the rally behind the scenes, although the campaign says they were acting on their own. Of the 12 people listed on the permit as onsite contacts, seven were on the Trump campaign\\'s payroll during the 2020 election, according to campaign finance records -- many of whom worked in roles that involved event planning or production. They include Justin Caporale, the Trump campaign\\'s director of advance and a former director of operations for first lady Melania Trump, who was listed on the permit as the project manager for the rally; Megan Powers, who worked as director of operations for Trump\\'s campaign through January 2021, according to her LinkedIn page, and was listed as an operations manager for the rally; and Maggie Mulvaney, the niece of former White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and the director of finance operations for the Trump campaign, who was listed as the rally\\'s VIP lead.

They include Tim Unes, whose event planning company, Event Strategies, Inc., helped produce Trump rallies and has worked on numerous Republican campaigns, and who served as stage manager for the January 6 rally. Unes told CNN that he and his company had nothing to do with the march to the Capitol or the riot.\"Our job here was to work on the rally specifically on the Ellipse -- we did not have anything to do with the march,\" Unes said. \"Like any other good American, I am disgusted by what I saw of those people breaking into the Capitol.\"Trump campaign denies ties to with the rallyA tenth staffer, Hannah Salem, who was listed on the permit as an operations manager for the January 6 rally, was paid by the Trump campaign for event consulting in 2018 according to campaign records and also worked as Special Assistant to the President and director of press advance, according to a biography on her event management company\\'s website. The biography said she helped plan summits between Trump and foreign dignitaries such as Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, the Queen of England, and Pope Francis.Some of the rally staffers\\' previous work for the Trump campaign and the White House was first reported by the Associated Press. Altogether, the Trump campaign paid the 10 staffers who worked on the January 6 rally more than $1.4 million in salaries, consulting fees, and reimbursements between 2015 and November 2020, according to a CNN analysis of the FEC data. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign said that the staffers were working on their own, and that the campaign had no ties with the rally. \"The Trump campaign did not organize, operate or finance the event,\" campaign spokesperson Jason Miller told CNN in a text message on Monday. \"No campaign staff was involved in the organization or operation of the event. If any former employees or independent contractors for the campaign worked on this event they did not do so at the direction of the Trump campaign.\"   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther than Unes, none of the other staffers or contractors who worked on the Trump campaign and the rally responded to requests for comment sent to emails, LinkedIn accounts, or phone numbers listed in public records. One person close to the organization of the rally, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share details about the event\\'s planning, also said that the Trump campaign had not been involved. Many of the former Trump campaign staffers were junior level employees, they said.\"Hiring former campaign workers was really just a matter of getting the logistics done,\" the person said. \"Young campaign staffers who were let go after the election are out of work and familiar with the work ... they\\'re kids and they don\\'t have paychecks, that\\'s why they were hired.\" The group that planned the rally, Women for America First, did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CNN. The group was founded by Amy Kremer, who previously worked as an executive of the conservative group Tea Party Express, and her daughter Kylie Jane Kremer is listed on the permit as the \"person in charge\" of the event.In the permit approved days before the rally, the organizers referred to the possibility of other events at the Capitol that day but said their group wouldn\\'t be involved. \"Women for America First will not conduct an organized march from the Ellipse at the conclusion of the rally,\" the permit read. \"Some participants may leave to attend rallies at the United States Capitol to hear the results of Congressional certification of the Electoral College count.\"Trump leaves America at its most divided since the Civil WarOther conservative figures and groups that were involved in organizing the rally have stressed that they planned a peaceful protest and have argued that they shouldn\\'t be held responsible for the violent actions of the rioters that followed. \"Any suggestion that Stop the Steal participated in, led, or breached the Capitol building, itself, is defamatory and untrue,\" Ali Alexander, an organizer with the Stop the Steal group, told CNN in an email. \"We cannot control the broader public any more than Nancy Pelosi does Antifa.\"Meanwhile, other prominent conservative groups also helped promote the rally. The Rule of Law Defense Fund, a nonprofit associated with the Republican Attorney Generals Association, released robocalls urging supporters to march on the Capitol.\"At 1:00 p.m., we will march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal,\" the robocall said, according to a recording first reported by the news website Documented. \"We are hoping patriots like you will join us to continue to fight to protect the integrity of our elections.\" Adam Piper, the executive director of the attorneys general group, resigned last week amid controversy over the call.The group\\'s chairman, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, told the Montgomery Advertiser newspaper that he had not authorized the robocalls and the group is \"engaging in a vigorous review\" of the incident. Charlie Kirk, the founder and president of influential conservative group Turning Point USA, tweeted two days before the rally that his organization Students for Trump was \"sending 80+ buses full of patriots to DC to fight for this president.\" He declared that the rally supporting Trump \"will likely be one of the largest and most consequential in American history.\"Kirk later deleted the tweet, which was saved in a snapshot on the Internet Archive\\'s Wayback Machine and was first reported by the news website The Daily Dot. A spokesperson for Turning Point Action, a political group affiliated with Turning Point USA, told CNN that Students for Trump only sent seven buses of students to the rally, and that the buses took the attendees out of the area after Trump finished speaking.  (CNN)Steve Bannon evoked the beaches of Normandy. Michael Flynn drew comparisons to Civil War battlefields and spoke of Americans who died for their country. Roger Stone called it a struggle \"between the godly and the godless, between good and evil.\" Rudy Giuliani called for \"trial by combat.\" Ali Alexander said it would be a \"knife fight.\" As 2020 faded into 2021, some of President Donald Trump\\'s most influential supporters -- among them members of his inner circle who were in direct contact with the President -- spoke in ominous and violent terms about what was coming on January 6. Even as anxious eyes turn toward the Inauguration Day on January 20, the words of these firebrands in the leadup to the riots at the Capitol raise crucial questions about the relationship between the rhetoric of far-right figureheads and the violence that unfolded on January 6. \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\" Bannon, Trump\\'s former top White House adviser, promised listeners of his podcast -- called \"War Room\" -- on January 5. The next day, Trump himself gave a rambling speech near the White House where he claimed the election \"was stolen from you, from me and from the country,\" and called on supporters to \"walk down to the Capitol.\"Read MoreIn this January 6, 2021 photo, supporters listen as President Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Washington that preceded the deadly assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.\"We are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\" he added, \"and we are probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you will never take back our country with weakness.\" Soon after, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, killing a police officer and assaulting others before charging inside -- some carrying weapons and zip-tie handcuffs.\"What we have is influential, powerful people influencing the President and pushing out messages that are radicalizing large chunks of the population,\" said Heidi Beirich, chief strategy officer for the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit organization that monitors extremism around the world. \"It\\'s very dangerous.\" To be sure, as a rule most speech that doesn\\'t convey a direct threat or incite \"imminent lawless action\" is protected under the First Amendment.But experts told CNN they believe Trump and his most visible allies bear a great deal of responsibility for stoking the flames that led to the January 6 uprising. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"When you are an adviser to a President, formal or informal, you need to think about the impact of anti-democratic rhetoric,\" said John Hudak, an expert on governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \"And the President himself, and a lot of the President\\'s supporters and certainly his children, seem to believe that it is responsible for a President and his advisers and family to be anti-democratic. That\\'s a real problem. And we haven\\'t really experienced that in our history.\"Trump has already paid a historic price for his words, with the US House on Wednesday voting to make him the only American president to have been impeached twice -- this time for \"incitement of insurrection.\" But while much attention has been paid to Trump\\'s words in the run up to the breach of the US Capitol, less talked about is the fiery rhetoric of his most high-profile champions.Bannon and Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment. Stone rejected CNN\\'s questions as \"defamatory attempts to say that my belief in God and my view of the last election in apocalyptic terms is somehow inciting violence.\" Alexander argued he had \"no involvement in the breach of the US Capitol.\" Flynn attorney Sidney Powell, who herself is facing a defamation lawsuit over her claims about the election (she\\'s denied the allegations), insisted that Flynn \"encourages patriotism and lawful political action,\" and to suggest otherwise is \"absolutely ludicrous.\"Bannon\\'s menacing metaphorsFormer White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon exits the Manhattan Federal Court on August 20, 2020 in the Manhattan borough of New York City. In the weeks between the election and that day, Bannon and his guests and co-hosts on his \"War Room\" podcast relentlessly promoted conspiracy theories of election fraud and cast the fight to overturn the election results in war-like and often apocalyptic terms.Bannon\\'s menacing metaphors first landed him in hot water a few days after on Election Day, when he suggested in a video that posted to several of his social media accounts that, if he were in charge, he wouldn\\'t merely fire FBI Director Christopher Wray and Anthony Fauci -- the US government\\'s top infectious disease expert -- but would put their heads on pikes \"as a warning to federal bureaucrats.\" Twitter permanently suspended his account.In December, Bannon\\'s co-host tweeted a video of Bannon speaking on \"War Room\" overlaid with cinematic music and dramatic images from the famous D-Day battle scene of \"Saving Private Ryan.\" In it, he spoke of the \"moral obligation\" Trump supporters have to \"the kids that died at Normandy.\" He added that if they allow Biden -- \"that feckless old man\" -- to win, \"I want you to explain that to the 20-year-old kid in the first wave on D-Day.\"JUST WATCHEDAvlon: Here\\'s a way to turn down the \\'MAGAphone\\'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAvlon: Here\\'s a way to turn down the \\'MAGAphone\\' 03:07On December 28, Bannon insisted that patriotic Trump supporters had to be ready to fight in the spirit of George Washington\\'s soldiers during the American Revolution and American soldiers on D-Day in World War II. \"That\\'s our DNA, that\\'s where we come from,\" Bannon said.Bannon began promoting the upcoming DC protests of January 6.  \"l\\'ll tell you this,\" Bannon said the day before the riot.  \"It\\'s not going to happen like you think it\\'s going to happen. OK, it\\'s going to be quite extraordinarily different. And all I can say is, strap in ... You have made this happen and tomorrow it\\'s game day. So strap in.

Just before Christmas, Alexander -- a political activist who has organized pro-Trump rallies, including one of the demonstrations that converged on the Capitol lawn on January 6 -- used violent metaphors to hint at what was to come in January when speaking to followers of his livestream channel on the social media platform Periscope. In his freewheeling monologue, Alexander credited Roger Stone, a veteran Republican operative and self-described \"dirty trickster\" whose 40-month prison sentence for seven felonies was cut short by Trump\\'s commutation in July. (He was given a full pardon in December). \"This is something Roger and I have been planning for a long time,\" Alexander said. \"And finally, he\\'s off the leash. So, you know, it\\'s a knife fight and your two knife fighters are Ali Alexander and Roger Stone, and you either fight with us or you get slashed. So I\\'ll let you guys know more about what that means as we evolve.\"  Alexander has helped turn the \"Stop the Steal\" slogan that Stone launched on Trump\\'s behalf during the 2016 primaries into a rallying cry for conservatives around the country.At a DC rally on the night of January 5, Stone took the stage clad in one of his trademark pinstripe suits as a dance track titled \"Roger Stone did nothing wrong\" blared from the speakers.JUST WATCHED15 hours of chaos that led to Trump\\'s impeachmentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH15 hours of chaos that led to Trump\\'s impeachment 04:47After repeating the falsehood that the election was stolen from Trump, Stone, 68, rallied the faithful with an us-versus-them battle cry. \"This is nothing less than an epic struggle for the future of this country between dark and light, between the godly and the godless, between good and evil,\" he said. \"And we will win this fight or America will step off into a thousand years of darkness. We dare not fail. I will be with you tomorrow shoulder to shoulder.\" Stone also has bumped elbows with extremist groups, most notably the Proud Boys. In September he endorsed the congressional candidacy of Nick Ochs, who founded the Hawaii chapter of the far-right organization. Ochs, whose bid for the US House came up short, was arrested for his role in the Capitol siege. Law enforcement was alerted to it by the photo Ochs posted on Twitter of himself enjoying a cigarette in the building, and by the comments he made to a CNN reporter. Long a dispenser of supercharged rhetoric, Stone was not muted by his recent run-in with the law, and was talking about election fraud even before November.In September, he went on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\\' show, InfoWars, and the two mused discursively about \"fake ballots,\" Big Tech and the Clintons.\"If someone will study the president\\'s authority in the Insurrection Act in his ability to impose, impose martial law,\" Stone said, \"if there is widespread cheating, he will have the authority to arrest (Mark) Zuckerberg, to arrest Tim Cook, to arrest the Clintons, to arrest anybody else who can be proven to be involved in illegal activity.\"War analogies aboundFormer US National Security Advisor Michael Flynn speaks to supporters of President Donald Trump during the Million MAGA March to protest the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in front of the US Supreme Court on December 12, 2020 in Washington, DC. For his part, Jones has joined \"Stop the Steal\" efforts since the November election and used inflammatory, dark rhetoric to bolster the movement\\'s false claims.Two days after election day, Jones said, \"We are in the attempted overthrow of our country.\" When a guest on the show mentioned people showing up in person to protest the counting of votes, Jones drew a comparison to World War II. \"It\\'s like when Hitler was bombing London, most Brits were against a war because they had World War I. But once Hitler bombed them, over 95% said let\\'s go to war,\" he said. \"This is a war. This is not regular times.\"Jones did not respond to CNN\\'s request for comment.Also employing war analogies is another beneficiary of Trump\\'s pardon powers -- Michael T. Flynn, Trump\\'s former national security adviser.JUST WATCHEDFact Check: The lies that could define Trump\\'s legacyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFact Check: The lies that could define Trump\\'s legacy 04:09Speaking to a fired-up crowd at the DC rally on January 5, Flynn -- who was pardoned by Trump in November after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat -- managed to pack election-fraud conspiracy theories, violent innuendo and a call to action into a couple of sentences. \"In some of these states, we have more dead voters than are buried on the battlefields of Gettysburg, or the battlefields of Vicksburg, or the battlefields of Normandy,\" he said. \"Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you that don\\'t have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow, we the people are going to be here, and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie.\"Much of the rhetoric leading up to the riot has been draped in the language of existential threat. Speaking at a January 6 rally just before the siege, Rudy Giuliani -- Trump\\'s personal attorney -- spoke in grandiose terms about the stakes at hand. \"This is bigger than Donald Trump,\" he said. \"It\\'s bigger than you and me. It\\'s about these monuments and what they stand for. This has been a year in which they have invaded our freedom of speech, our freedom of religion, our freedom to move, our freedom to live. I\\'ll be darned if they\\'re going to take away our free and fair vote. And we\\'re going to fight to the very end to make sure that doesn\\'t happen.\"His mention of \"trial by combat\" was cited by the New York State Bar Association, which has launched an inquiry into Giuliani to determine whether he should be expelled from the group.\"Mr. Giuliani\\'s words quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election\\'s outcome to take matters into their own hands,\" the group said in a statement. \"Their subsequent attack on the Capitol was nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power.\"Experts concerned that incitement is far from overJohn Scott-Railton, a researcher at University of Toronto\\'s Citizen Lab who now works with others to identify extremist groups who were part of the Capitol mob, said the rhetoric plays into the fantasies of armed protesters who have been gunning for a civil war.\"They\\'re ready -- it\\'s what they\\'ve been prancing around in the woods, playing dress up, preparing for,\" he said. \"I\\'m just terribly worried that they weren\\'t satisfied with what happened on the sixth, and they\\'re going to come back for more.\" As for Bannon, the tenor of his podcast took a turn once the violence started unfolding. On the morning of January 6, before the rally and march on the Capitol, Bannon echoed Stone\\'s words by saying the day would be a battle between \"the children of light and the forces of darkness.\" But the podcast\\'s tone shifted sharply as footage of the violence at the Capitol was broadcast nationwide. Even as Bannon and his co-podcasters continued to describe Vice President Mike Pence as a traitor, they absolved Trump and themselves from any responsibility for fomenting violence. \"What\\'s going on right now was choices made by individuals who are fed up with what they\\'ve seen happen,\" said right-wing activist Ben Bergquam on a War Room episode later that same day. \"When I\\'m talking to people on the ground, that is what I\\'m hearing over and over and over again, it has nothing to do with President Trump\\'s words.\" Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, said anyone paying attention knew the events on January 6 would be a magnet for angry people. The violence of extremists, he added, has historically been sparked by a fear that something is being taken away -- be it a White majority, guns or a way of life. \"Whether it\\'s illegal or not, people have gotta know better,\" he said. \"You don\\'t have to be a genius to know how people are incited by words.\"CNN\\'s Nelli Black, Scott Bronstein, Bob Ortega, Benjamin Naughton and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report.  (CNN)President Donald Trump\\'s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has been working to bolster conspiratorial claims that left-wing agitators played a dominant role in the last week\\'s Capitol riot. Giuliani claimed in a tweet on Friday that has since been removed by Twitter that the Capitol siege was carried out \"by groups like ANTIFA trained to riot.\"  Attorney for the President, Rudy Giuliani, speaks at a news conference in the parking lot of a landscaping company on November 7, 2020 in Philadelphia.Giuliani has zeroed in on self-described leftist activist John Earle Sullivan of Utah, who was charged in federal court Thursday on three counts related to the Capitol riot, and has argued that the presence and statements of Sullivan and other unidentified rioters indicate that the storming was driven by forces opposed to Trump.    \"We have people who invaded like Mr. Sullivan and his apparently Black Lives Matter directed group of rioters and looters and whatever else they are,\" Giuliani said in a Thursday episode of his podcast titled \"Another FRAME UP.\" What we know about potential armed protests ahead of Joe Biden\\'s inaugurationHe also claimed that the riot was something \"that the President had nothing to do with.\" Read MoreThe \"Antifa\" argument is just one of a number conspiracy theories Giuliani has pushed on behalf of Trump since the November election. Giuliani, who is still expected to play a role in Trump\\'s impeachment defense even though the President has told staff not to pay him, did not respond to CNN\\'s requests for comment.  Giuliani\\'s tweet was first reported by the Emptywheel blog, a site specializing in national security and civil liberties issues.In the now-removed Tweet, Giuliani included a screenshot of a text purportedly from Sullivan\\'s brother James in which the sender claimed to be working with the FBI \"to expose and place total blame on John\" and more than 200 members of Antifa. Neither Giuliani nor James Sullivan have produced evidence to support the claim that Antifa was involved in the January 6 riot. Federal law enforcement officials have said they have found no evidence suggesting Antifa played a significant role in the insurrection.John Sullivan and his brother James appear to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum.James Sullivan is an ardent Trump supporter, according to his Facebook page. He is also the co-founder of Civilized Awakenings, a civil rights organization that seeks to help Black conservatives \"find real solutions to the problems the Black Americans are facing.\" In a brief interview with CNN, a spokesperson for Civilized Awakenings confirmed Sullivan had spoken at a Proud Boys rally in Portland but stressed neither he nor Civilized Awakenings are part of that group. The spokesperson also confirmed Sullivan has been in contact with Rudy Giuliani, but declined to discuss the details. James Sullivan declined comment.Neither John Sullivan nor the attorney representing him on the charges stemming from the Capitol siege could be reached for comment Friday evening. Attorney Peter Kern, who represents Sullivan in a separate criminal case filed this summer in Utah declined to characterize any political affiliations Sullivan may have.275 cases open in Capitol riot investigation, US prosecutors sayDuring the siege, John Sullivan recorded the mayhem and provided commentary on what was going on. He was charged with disorderly conduct, interfering with law enforcement, and knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building, according to a criminal complaint. He was taken into custody in Utah, where he lives.According to the complaint, Sullivan told the FBI he was an activist and journalist who filmed protests and riots, \"but admitted that he did not have any press credentials.\" He told agents he was wearing a ballistic vest and gas mask and entered the building through a broken window, the affidavit states. While standing outside the Capitol building before entering, he proclaimed, \"Let\\'s burn this sh*t down.\"Once inside, he can be heard on audio arguing with police and telling them to stand down or that they might get hurt, according to the affidavit.\"You are putting yourself in harm\\'s way,\" he allegedly told officers. \"The people have spoken.\" The arrest affidavit also says that as a crowd attempted to open doors to one part of the Capitol, Sullivan can be heard on the video saying, \"Hey guys, I have a knife. I have a knife. Let me up.\"Federal authorities have not identified John Sullivan as a member of Antifa, and he denied supporting Antifa in an interview with a Utah newspaper last week. Sullivan said in the same interview that he didn\\'t encourage violence or vandalism.When asked about some of the things he said during a 40-minute video he recorded of the incident, he said, \"When you\\'re in a massive crowd like that, you have to blend in.\"The paper, The Deseret News, also reported in July that Sullivan is part of a group called \"Insurgence USA\" and took part in a protest in June in which he and others demonstrated in opposition to a scheduled pro-law enforcement demonstration. The paper reported he was arrested after the protest and booked into jail for investigation of \"rioting, making a threat of violence and criminal mischief.\"That case is pending, online court records show. Kern said Sullivan\\'s arraignment had been postponed and he had yet to enter a plea. In August, Sullivan was in Washington, DC, speaking to a gathering at Black Lives Matter Plaza, according to a video on YouTube.\"We [expletive] about to burn this [expletive] down,\" he told the crowd. \"We got to rip Trump right out of that office over there.\"He then led the crowd in a chant of, \"It\\'s time for a revolution.\"In the aftermath of last week\\'s siege on the capitol, Sullivan appeared on CNN\\'s AC360 and ABC\\'s Good Morning America, commenting on dramatic footage he shot inside the Capitol.\"By no means am I there on the Trump side or the Biden side,\" he told Anderson Cooper.  (CNN)As he fired up a crowd of Trump supporters gathered at Arizona\\'s state capitol last month, Rep. Paul Gosar falsely assured them that the election results could still be overturned. \"Once we conquer the Hill,\" the six-term Republican declared to a wave of cheers, \"Donald Trump is returned to being the president.\"Two and a half weeks later, Gosar was repeating baseless claims about stolen ballots and rigged voting machines in a speech to Congress when he found himself interrupted by chaos on the House floor. Within minutes, lawmakers were being evacuated out of the chambers as rioters advanced through the heart of American democracy -- spurred by the same rhetoric Gosar and some of his fellow Republicans had espoused. The first part of Gosar\\'s prediction, at least, had come true: Capitol Hill had been conquered. The insurrection last week that left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer, has spurred a new move to impeach President Donald Trump and a wave of criticism for the most prominent senators who voted to block President-elect Joe Biden\\'s victory. But Gosar and several other of his GOP colleagues in the House are also facing new scrutiny for their incendiary language in the hours, days and weeks before the siege. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., objects to certifying Arizona\\'s Electoral College votes during a joint session of the House and Senate convenes to count the electoral votes cast in November\\'s election, at the Capitol, Wednesday, Jan 6, 2021. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)One of the top organizers of the movement that aimed to overturn the election results has claimed he worked closely with Republican congressmen. Ali Alexander, a leader of the \"Stop the Steal\" group, said in several Periscope livestream videos last month that he planned the rally that preceded the riot in conjunction with Gosar and two other congressional Republicans, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona, as CNN first reported last week.Read More\"We\\'re the four guys who came up with a January 6 event,\" Alexander said in one video in December. \"It was to build momentum and pressure and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congress peoples who weren\\'t yet decided or saw everyone outside and said, \\'I can\\'t be on the other side of that mob.\\'\" Brooks, a staunch conservative and one of Trump\\'s closest congressional allies, was one of the first speakers at the National Mall rally that preceded the riot, and his fiery language helped set the tone for what came next. \"Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass!\" the six-term Republican shouted to the assembled protesters. \"Our ancestors sacrificed their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes and sometimes their lives... Are you willing to do the same?\"Hours later, when some of the same people Brooks had spoken to were smashing windows at the US Capitol, the lawmaker livetweeted as he and his colleagues were being evacuated from the House chambers. \"Tear gas dispersed in Capitol Rotunda,\" Brooks wrote in a tweet posted from his iPad. \"Congressmen ordered to grab gas masks under chairs in case have to leave in haste!\"Brooks was the first member of Congress to say publicly that he would object to the certification of the electoral votes for Biden. The day before the Jan. 6 rally, he tweeted that Trump had \"asked me personally to speak & tell the American people about the election system weaknesses that the Socialist Democrats exploited to steal this election.\"Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, speaks Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington, at a rally in support of President Donald Trump called the \"Save America Rally.\" (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)After the insurrection, while Brooks condemned rioters and called for them to be \"prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" he has also repeatedly suggested on social media and in interviews that at least some of the people who stormed the Capitol were members of the left-wing group Antifa -- a baseless claim that has been widely debunked. Like Trump, who said Tuesday that his remarks at the rally, when he urged supporters to \"fight like hell,\" were \"totally appropriate,\" Brooks has denied responsibility for the riot, telling a radio show host the day after the attack that he \"absolutely\" had no regrets. He later argued in a statement Tuesday that his remarks could not have been the cause of the violence. \"No one at the rally interpreted my remarks to be anything other than what they were: A pep talk after the derriere kicking conservatives suffered in the dismal 2020 elections,\" Brooks wrote.Gosar has closely associated himself with the Stop the Steal movement for months. He tagged or replied to Alexander in more than two dozen tweets since Election Day, sharing false rumors about mysteriously appearing ballots and deleted vote counts, and spoke at the December 19 rally at the Arizona state capitol that Alexander organized. He penned an online open letter last month titled \"Are We Witnessing a Coup d\\'etat?\"\"Biden should concede,\" Gosar tweeted on the morning of last week\\'s congressional vote, sharing a photo of the pro-Trump protesters gathered in front of the Washington Monument. \"I want his concession on my desk tomorrow morning. Don\\'t make me come over there.\"As the insurrection was still going on, Gosar shared divergent messages about the rioters. In one tweet with a photo of people scaling the walls of the Capitol, Gosar wrote \"let\\'s not get carried away here,\" adding that \"if anyone on the ground reads this and is beyond the line come back.\" But on the right-wing social media network Parler, which has since gone offline, Gosar posted the same image with a different caption: \"Americans are upset.\"Even Gosar\\'s family members say his language has gone too far. Several of his siblings -- who recorded a viral campaign ad for one of his opponents in 2018 -- have argued he should resign or be removed. \"My brother swore an oath to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic,\" the congressman\\'s younger brother Tim Gosar, a private investigator in Fort Collins, Colorado, told CNN this week. \"And he has blatantly broken that oath.\"Gosar\\'s office did not respond to a request for comment. UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 3: Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is seen after a news conference with members of the House Freedom Caucus to call on Attorney General William Barr to release findings of an investigation into allegations of 2020 election fraud, outside the Capitol on Thursday, December 3, 2020. (Photo CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)At the Arizona Stop the Steal rally with Gosar, Alexander played a video that he said Biggs, the chair of the conservative Freedom Caucus, had sent for the crowd.\"Andy Biggs here,\" the Arizona congressman said in the recording. \"I wish I could be with you. I\\'m in the DC swamp fighting on behalf of Arizona\\'s residents and freedom fighters all over the country.\" The crowd responded with a chant of \"Biggs! Biggs! Biggs!\" The Arizona Republic first reported the video on Monday. A Biggs spokesperson told CNN that the congressman recorded the video at the request of Gosar\\'s staff, and had never worked with Alexander.\"Congressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point -- let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest,\" the spokesperson said. \"He did not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests.\"Biggs was one of several Republican members of Congress who refused to wear masks in a secure room where lawmakers were staying during the riot, according to a video posted by the congressional news site Punchbowl. Several Democratic members have said in recent days that they tested positive for Covid after being in the room. Other congressional Republicans also painted their efforts to oppose Biden\\'s victory in sweeping, historic terms. In the days before the riot, Freshman Reps. Laura Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia both called the Wednesday electoral vote certification a \"1776 moment.\" And speaking at the same rally as Brooks and Trump, Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, another newly elected member, told the crowd that \"the Republicans are hiding and not fighting\" and \"they are trying to silence your voice.\" \"I want you to chant with me so loud that the cowards in Washington DC that I serve with can hear you,\" he declared. Newly elected U.S. Rep Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) speaks as supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump gather by the White House ahead of Trump\\'s speech to contest the certification by the U.S. Congress of the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election in Washington, U.S, January 6, 2021. REUTERSA Cawthorn spokesperson said the congressman condemned the violence during the riot and has criticized Trump for \"directing protestors toward the Capitol.\"Two Democrats have introduced a resolution to censure Brooks for his comments at the rally, and others have argued for expelling Gosar and other congressional Republicans who backed efforts to overturn the election. Democratic leaders have not made plans yet to vote on a censure resolution, but the subject has been discussed repeatedly during private conference calls, Democratic sources say.\"Mo Brooks and others like him should resign,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on CNN Monday. \"They should have the decency to resign. They don\\'t belong in this institution. They have demonstrated a contempt for democracy and for freedom.\"Denver Riggleman, a moderate Republican who lost his primary nomination last year to a more conservative challenger, said that he thought GOP leaders needed to have a \"come to Jesus\" moment and hold the congressmen who fanned the flames of insurrection accountable. But he said he doubted that the GOP base would punish members like Gosar or Brooks when they were back on the ballot.\"Those elected officials probably will get reelected, and that\\'s that\\'s the issue that we have right now,\" Riggleman said. \"I think that\\'s what scares me the most.\"CNN\\'s Nelli Black, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Ben Naughton, Bob Ortega contributed to this report.
